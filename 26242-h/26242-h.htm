</div>

<p>All around stretched the great blue sky and the blue
sea of the Gulf of Bengal.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clifton lay dozing at full length on a pillowed
bench and her husband sat near her and followed his
Lily, his daughter, with his eyes: his Lily, eight years old,
&#8220;that high,&#8221; waving among the passengers the white coral
necklace which Pa had bought her on leaving Australia;
his Lily, his star, his New Zealander on Wheels! His
Lily who had had such successes at Melbourne, at Sidney:
bouquets, tons and cart-loads of bouquets! And
the past would be nothing compared with the future, with
the astounding tricks which he was inventing for his
Lily. The mere sight of her raised his enthusiasm to boiling-point.
And he was going to show them, in Calcutta
and elsewhere, if they knew how to make stars in New
Zealand or if they were only fit for raising mutton.</p>
<p>Clifton was an artist, an &#8220;artiste,&#8221; a born artiste: starting
as a mere clerk in an office, he had become an amateur
cyclist and then a professional on the track. He married
an Englishwoman at Wellington and, at Lily&#8217;s birth, decided
upon a career: the stage, with Lily for a star later
on! And he set to work, with vim and vigor, learned a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
few tricks on his bike, taught his wife the business in less
than no time; and Lily&#8217;s first memories as a four-year-old
were:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sitting on Ma&#8217;s shoulders, Ma on Pa&#8217;s and Pa
on the bike.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily zigzagged through New Zealand, from east
to west and north to south, and Australia after, where
she received plenty of applause for her tricks, childish in
themselves, but well presented. Her triumphant path
wound among tinseled bottles containing paper flowers,
with a faultless standstill for the climax, one hand on
the handle-bar, the other blowing kisses to the audience.
This procured Pa an engagement for India. He ordered
a beautiful colored poster, &#8220;The Clifton Family, Trick
Cyclists,&#8221; with a portrait in the corner of his own strong
face and bristling mustache&mdash;&#8220;P. T. Clifton, Manager&#8221;&mdash;one
more rung in the ladder of life mounted,
thanks to his Lily.</p>
<p>And Pa smiled to his daughter and, as she ran past him,
lifted her on his knee and stroked her fair curls; and the
child cuddled up to her Pa, opened her lips to ask questions,
but was silent, with her eyes lost in space, puckering
her little forehead, in which were heaped so many mingled
memories of the stage and the great world outside:
the Boxing Kangaroo; tall cliffs; green islands; the
bike; Batavia among the trees; Singapore, with its noise
and dust. And Lily, wearily, dreamed and murmured
things, while the steamer sped on, thud, thud, thud, flat
as a stage in its blue &#8220;set.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily&#8217;s impressions of India were months of jolting and
bumping, stops in the dead of night while the tent was
pitched, rains, strong smells, oppressive heats&mdash;months
and months of it, Ma on Pa, Pa on the wheel and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
on top, waving flags. Yellow faces on the benches,
red flowers and, somewhere, on a river-bank, two eyes
glittering in the dark: a tiger, somebody said! And
every night the artistes, carrying lanterns, walked in file
between the circus and the hotel, with the ladies in the
center and Lily clinging to Ma&#8217;s skirt.</p>
<p>She did more now, in addition to the bike: a song-and-dance
turn. In a piping falsetto, she quavered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Star light! Star bright!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was spoiled by the ladies, the wives of the officers
stationed in those out-of-the-way holes. She played with
smart children, was taken for drives, had her social successes!
Chocolates, sweets, kisses. And a lady gave her
such a pretty dress: his Lily! Pa burst with delighted
pride to see her treated like that; and Ma scolded her a
bit, for the little flirt that she was, while fondly tying the
two satin bows over her ears.</p>
<p>Lily was a regular tomboy, with pranks invented by
herself, from ideas which she picked up in traveling: for
instance, she would choose her moment and chuck a piece
of bacon among the Mohammedans sitting under her window;
and she would revel in her own fright at those
furious faces suddenly glaring up at her from below!
And she would stand with drooping head, one finger in
her mouth:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>so</i> sorry!&#8221;</p>
<p>What fun! And as an artiste she was spoiled and petted
everywhere. Goa, Bangalore, Tanjore and then Colombo,
and a ship with elephants, tigers, camels, children, men,
women, wagons, one great mix-up, a circus and menagerie
in one, steaming toward South Africa; and Miss Lily
of the Clifton Troupe paraded her well-brushed, neatly-parted
curls in the midst of it all, gazed open-mouthed at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
the blue expanse of water until, her eyes drunk and dazed
with light, she went and lay in her cabin....
And more and more blue water. And thud, thud,
thud. And Cape Town in the mountains. Africa behind
it: a country all yellow, where the trains wound in and
out of the rocks; villages, up, up, up, or else right low
down, on the yellow veldt; and, at night, on the benches,
crowds and crowds. Immediately after the show came
sleep, troubled by the jolting of the train; and the circus
was always there next day, on the right or on the left,
with its Chinamen and its niggers driving stakes or tugging
at ropes. A bell for dinner, a whistle for the show;
and, as soon as the show was over, to bed,&mdash;and off again.</p>
<p>Pa made her practice harder now, wanted to make a
great artiste of her. And there was a class, too, kept by
a &#8220;marm&#8221; who traveled with the circus and taught spelling
and arithmetic and the art of letter-writing, from
&#8220;Yours to hand with thanks&#8221; down to &#8220;Believe me to be.&#8221;
Lily would have been bored to death but for the accidents
of travel: sometimes the engine broke down, bringing the
train to a dead stop amid the great African silence, near
a field of Indian corn, in which the children played hide-and-seek.
Or else there were locusts, locusts &#8220;that thick,&#8221;
right inside the carriages. Lily would tie them by the leg
and:</p>
<p>&#8220;Flip! Flap! Lively now! Jump!&#8221;</p>
<p>But funniest of all was the caravan&mdash;she couldn&#8217;t remember
where, in Natal or thereabouts&mdash;wagons with ten
yoke of oxen. They climbed up endless winding roads.
The men shot at birds and prospected for diamonds along
the wayside; and at night they took the hay from the
mattresses to give to the cattle. Lolling indolence was in
the air and plenty in the larder: big fruits, strange game,
which they cooked in a makeshift oven consisting of a
few stones. Then they rolled themselves up in a blanket,
near the elephants tugging at their chains, and slept under
the tent in the cool, bright, starry night.</p>

LILY IN INDIA<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>Months and months passed. Lily was becoming very
clever: the New Zealander on Wheels! She was cleverer
than Pa, who no longer performed, nor Ma either. On
their return to Australia, Lily appeared by herself in the
music-halls, and P. T. Clifton, Manager, watched her
from the wings, in growing admiration: his Lily was a
star now, too good for a circus! And Australia, pooh!
Sidney, Melbourne, pooh! What Lily wanted was New
York, London, the Hippodromes, the Palaces! He&#8217;d
show them a star that was a star! And Clifton clenched
his fists and pretended not to see when Lily made a blunder
on the stage: his Lily missing a trick! Disgracing her
Pa like that! He blushed to the eyes at the thought of it!
And, when she returned to the wings, he twitted her
proudly:</p>
<p>&#8220;What next, Lily! An artiste like you!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Ma adopted a sarcastic air and congratulated
&#8220;mademoiselle&#8221; as she threw the white wrapper over
&#8220;mademoiselle&#8217;s&#8221; shoulders.</p>
<p>Ma detested the stage. She did not think it a nice place
for herself; but for a brat like Lily, Lord, it was quite
different! And she ought to have tried to please her
Pa and Ma. Mrs. Clifton, though she never voiced the
wish, had visions of a trip to London, to stagger some relations,
a sister-in-law she had there, and sneer at the old
country, in the usual colonial fashion, and show them
what the new countries can do, countries where you make
a fortune in less than no time! And, little by little, smitten
with Mr. Clifton&#8217;s enthusiasm, she came to believe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
that, in Lily, they really possessed the infant prodigy, the
treasure-child upon whom their fortune depended. And
Ma, too, was vexed when Lily missed a trick on the stage.</p>
<p>Lily laughed at their anger. Ma had never raised a hand
to her; and, as for Pa, when he scolded, Lily had such
a way of looking at him, with lowered head&mdash;&#8220;Oh, <i>so</i>
sorry!&#8221;&mdash;that Pa simmered down again at once. Lily, a
regular &#8220;tenter,&#8221; shot up freely, grew up a real tomboy,
went a bit too far, in fact, Ma said: at Honolulu, for instance,
on the road to &#8217;Frisco and New York, where Pa
had resolved to go, at all costs, come what might&mdash;it was
one step nearer London!&mdash;at Honolulu&mdash;ten days there
and such a success!&mdash;the child played truant in the gardens
teeming with birds and fruit, climbed apple-trees,
was caught one day and scampered off at full speed,
pursued by Ma, who threatened to give her a sound
smacking this time, the little thief! But Pa thought it
ridiculous, for the sake of an apple....</p>
<p>&#8220;And suppose Lily had broken her leg with her nonsense?&#8221;
asked Ma indignantly. &#8220;Where would your New
York be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pa felt himself a conquering hero when they steamed
through the Golden Gate: the States at last! And no
sooner was his foot on the wharf at &#8217;Frisco than off to the
agents at once, with his photographs, his contracts, his
posters! But it was her birth-certificate they asked to see.
And no babes and sucklings allowed on the stage here. It
was all right down yonder, but the law prevented it here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn your laws!&#8221; snapped Pa furiously. &#8220;Do you
think we make stars to hide them under bushels?&#8221;</p>
<p>And whoosh! Off for Mexico, where children are allowed
to perform.</p>
<p>Now, in Arizona, near Ph&oelig;nix, where the train stopped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
for some hours, owing to an accident to the Rio Gila
bridge, Pa happened upon a merrymaking which reminded
him of West Australia. Cow-boys, galloping
horses, a pretense at fighting, lassoing, revolvers, a track
for amateur cyclists and&mdash;yes, there, in the desert!&mdash;on
a platform, right in the middle, what should Pa see
but an amazing artiste, riding on the back-wheel, with the
other in the air! And such twirls! And the boys shouted
to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Trampy! Have a drink, Trampy!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Trampy accepted:</p>
<p>&#8220;With you, my lord! As soon as I&#8217;ve done, my lord!&#8221;</p>
<p>And off he wheeled, head on the saddle, feet in the air,
whistling <i>Yankee Doodle</i>!</p>
<p>It was impossible! Pa rubbed his eyes: what! Was
this what they did in the States in the desert? And he
who had hoped, with Lily ... why, damn it, Lily
knew nothing! He himself, her manager, knew less than
nothing! He, who thought he had formed a star! Pa
was red with shame. And, suddenly, he had a happy
thought: he, too, offered Trampy a drink, something to
propose to him....</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>They shook hands, went to the bar, lit a cigar, like men,
by Jove! Clifton loved to talk business, to pull out notebooks,
quick, and jot things down with a knowing air.
Trampy, a mere boy, easy-going, genial, without a red
cent for the time being, didn&#8217;t care a hang about business
and was soon telling Clifton the story of his life: drummer,
reporter, racer; his descent,&mdash;&#8220;Two whiskies, boy!&#8221;&mdash;what
was he saying? Oh, yes, his descent of a staircase
on the bike, yes, siree, with a red-hot stove under his arm&mdash;a
stove painted to look red-hot&mdash;pursued by a policeman,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
leaping over obstacles on the bike; great success at Duluth
and Denver as a tramp cyclist: hence his name of
Trampy Wheel-Pad. But those girls, by Jove! Well, he
who fights and runs away lives to fight another day. Still,
a rolling stone doesn&#8217;t climb hills. Here he was, stranded.
Go to Mexico? So much a week? Such and such a turn?
Teach the child? Cert!</p>
<p>Lily never alluded to Mexico afterward without shaking
with anger. My, to listen to her, how badly they
treated her in Mexico! Worse than a Dago! To tell the
truth, it was hot; and Lily, already tired by those long
journeys in varying climates, Lily would have preferred
to do nothing and to continue to lead her careless life as
a playful filly. But no, poor Lily was caught by the hind-leg
in Mexico! Ambition had seized upon Pa, body and
soul, and life became a more serious matter for the child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; said Pa, pointing to Trampy. &#8220;What he,
a man, does, you can do! I&#8217;ll see to that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pa arranged for a place in which to practise at their
ease. In the evening, on the stage, he watched and
studied Trampy&#8217;s tricks and, in the morning, quick, out
of bed, look alive, the bike! Pa no longer had his open-mouthed
admiration for Lily, as in South Africa and
Asia: his Lily knew nothing at all! But in three months,
six months, if necessary, if it cost him every penny he
possessed. And it was:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Lily ... to work! Show what
you can do!&#8221;</p>
<p>Trampy, in this country of <i>mañolas</i>&mdash;&#8220;Grand, by
Jove!&#8221;&mdash;came round about eleven; and Pa, all out of
breath, passed Lily on to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a go at her, Trampy! I give up, she won&#8217;t
do what I say!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>And Trampy put down his cigar, took off his collar and
cuffs and it was, &#8220;Come along, Lily!&#8221; till lunch-time. The
child, her eyes blinking with fatigue, fell fast asleep before
the end of the meal.</p>
<p>Pa was delighted.</p>
<p>And he confided her to Trampy more and more, with
orders not to spare smackings in case of need:</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, Lily? Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>As for him, he had business to do, letters to write,
great schemes in his head! for instance, he must try to
get permission for Lily to appear in the States.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time for a cigar, I guess,&#8221; said Trampy, as soon as
Clifton was gone.</p>
<p>Work stopped abruptly; a tumbler&#8217;s carpet rolled up
in a corner formed an inviting lounge; and Lily, panting
from her practice, would stretch herself beside him and
enjoy a few happy moments, the only really happy moments
of the day; for there were matinées in the afternoon
and the evening performance at night, till she was
ready to drop with weariness. Trampy treated Lily
nicely, like a grown-up person, called her by the name of
a fruit, or a flower, or a bird, jollied her, called her &#8220;little
wifie:&#8221; it was all one to her. He made her laugh with
his funny stories, his fairy tales about himself, his terrible
struggle with a snake in the streets of &#8217;Frisco, after
a champagne supper: girls, by Jove! He toned down his
anecdotes and dished them up for Lily&#8217;s entertainment;
told her absurd yarns enlivened with mimicry, in which
he excelled, like the real mummer that he was, and Lily
shrieked with laughter, head thrown back, full-throated.</p>
<p>And there was a spice of fear in it all: was that Pa
coming back? No, a carpenter or scene-shifter, perhaps,
or else the Martellos, brother and sister, going to practise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
slack-wire, head and hand balancing. Their father, old
Martello, a famous name, lived in London, it appeared,
alone with his Bambinis, mere babes still. His other
children and his apprentices had all run away, to escape
his horsewhip, and the brother in Mexico was continuing
the tradition. His brutality, in fact, got him into
trouble wherever he went, so much so that the big music-halls
were closed to him, for fear of scandal. And he
terrorized his sister, Ave Maria, a girl of sixteen, a dark
girl with great dark eyes. Ave Maria never spoke to
anybody; when she passed through the room where Lily
was having fun with Trampy, she fixed a fiery glance upon
them, even ventured on a smile, for Trampy in particular,
whose lively stories reached her through the partition
behind which she dressed. Oh, how she envied Lily!
But she passed very quickly, because of her brother.</p>
<p>And this time it was Pa! Lily jumped on to the saddle
like mad, played her part to perfection, puffed and panted,
as if the last drop of strength were oozing out of
her, and Trampy joined in the little comedy of fibbing
and dissembling:</p>
<p>&#8220;There, like that, Lily, or I&#8217;ll smack you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Pa. &#8220;Make her work!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, just to show Lily what work meant and that her
Pa was not so unkind after all&mdash;&#8220;It&#8217;s for your good, Lily!
You&#8217;ll thank me one of these days!&#8221;&mdash;he took her to the
stage, where Ave Maria was practising. Now, of course,
in the circuses, Lily, occasionally, had seen children
knocked and cut about with blows and trained to say,
&#8220;It was the cat,&#8221; when any one asked them about the
marks. They were ordinary children; she had rolled
about in the sawdust with them, played hide-and-seek
with them in the fields of Indian corn; they were children
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
who romped and ran about and laughed. Ave
Maria was different. The brother, a savage, scowling
brute, was always after her, harrying her with muttered
threats. She was in a constant, visible tremble of fear;
and, if she slipped on her wire, the fellow snarled as if
to bite her in the foot, pinched her black and blue, restored
her balance with a blow of the belt, shook the supports
to make her fall just to see!...</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Pa, he&#8217;ll kill her!&#8221; whispered Lily, when she saw
Ave Maria practising.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s none of our damned business,&#8221; replied Pa curtly.</p>
<p>Martello&#8217;s evil example ended by catching hold of Pa:
that&#8217;s how artistes were formed, damn it! And, at the
thought of the time wasted, he clenched his fists. To
have a Lily of his own, all his own, and to have made
nothing out of her yet! Still, it was not Lily&#8217;s fault.
Yes, though, it was her fault, she was so stubborn, so
wilful! When he told her to do a thing, why not do it?
Instead of bleating:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pa, I can&#8217;t! Pa, I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>A brief struggle, in a way, followed between Lily and
her Pa. Lily was not built for passive obedience, wasn&#8217;t
used to it. She no longer knew her Pa. When he came
at her with his hand lifted to strike, when he spoke of
unbuckling his belt&mdash;&#8220;Damn those blasted brats!&#8221;&mdash;Lily
eyed him with a look of anguish:</p>
<p>&#8220;But Pa, I&#8217;m not Ave Maria!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a
Dago.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she raised her little rebellious face to him. He
humbled her with a smack on the cheek:</p>
<p>&#8220;On the saddle! Up! Quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>The child, mastered by her Pa&#8217;s strength and energy,
ceased to be the spoiled child, became an artiste....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
Head on the saddle, back-wheel: just like Trampy!
Pooh, Trampy, after a few months of this life, was nowhere,
Clifton admired him less and less, Lily was doing
all that he did, more than he did; and without a fault,
without a hitch, unerring and exact! Pa swelled with
pride at the mere sight of his Lily, his four stone ten of
flesh and bones fitted to the machine, his Lily, the Lily of
his dreams!</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll dress you in velvet and satin!&#8221; he said, in his enthusiasm.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll cover you with diamonds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pa, thanks to his indomitable energy, had made something
of his Lily, a real artiste, at last! And business
was moving, too! He had a contract in his pocket for
the States, where Lily would no doubt get permission to
do her &#8220;childish tricks,&#8221; seeing that she was traveling
with her Pa and Ma. As for Trampy, Pa had no use for
Trampy, made no bones about sacking him on some pretext
or other:</p>
<p>&#8220;Run away and play with your girls, by Jove! Or
whatever you please! Good-by! Ta-ta!&#8221;</p>
<p>And off for Denver, whence they were to continue the
journey up to Chicago.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was the dive for good and all into the stuffy atmosphere
behind the scenes, which Lily was never again to
leave, brick walls, where she waited her turn on the elaborate
program of the &#8220;continuous performances,&#8221; amid
the thunder of the orchestra and the lightning of the reflectors.
No time to go out, meals consumed in your
dressing-room on the top of the basket trunk. In the
mornings, new tricks to practise on the stage, in the
midst of a herd of girls whom gentlemen in their shirtsleeves
were training to sing in chorus and to keep step
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
to the strum of the piano. And ever and ever so many
new faces, a tumult of tongues which Lily heard on the
stage, in the dressing-room, and even in her room at the
hotel, through the thin partition walls: a lingo made up
of coarse remarks and thick stories, punctuated with
spitting and oaths strong enough to carry a tower of
Babel. Lily opened her eyes and ears, heaping it all up,
storing it all away behind her stubborn forehead....</p>
<p>And new people, new people: &#8220;families,&#8221; &#8220;brothers,&#8221;
&#8220;sisters,&#8221; troupes, troupes, troupes! Or else stars by
themselves, &#8220;bests,&#8221; &#8220;uniques:&#8221; a female-impersonator,
a green-eyed boy who wagged his hips like the very devil
and took off the girls; Poland, a Warsaw Jewess, a redheaded,
overscented beauty, who did the &#8220;Parisienne,&#8221;
and ever and ever so many others. And Lily, so slender
and frail, was the pet of them all. They called her their
pretty baby, their <i>petit chéri</i>, and, with their painted
mugs, kissed her full on the lips.</p>
<p>Pa detested this &#8220;rotten lot&#8221; and Pa was not always
in a good temper. Lily &#8220;under age,&#8221;&mdash;again! Why,
there were even managers who informed the police, so as
to be on the safe side; &#8220;traveling with her parents; childish
tricks; nothing difficult.&#8221;... Ma&#8217;s indignation
knew no bounds: what nonsense to prevent a great big
girl of fifteen from earning her living! For she aged
Lily as much as she could, to obtain the permission,
when no papers were asked for; and she had trained
Lily to reply to the indiscreet questions of the officials:
was her trick hard? Was she forced into doing it? Lily
answered mechanically that she liked the bike very much.
And then they allowed her to perform.</p>
<p>As for practising, permission or none, that was nobody&#8217;s
damned business. And if some old sheep took to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
bleating&mdash;&#8220;Poor child, you&#8217;ll be the death of her!&#8221;&mdash;Pa
sent the old sheep to eat coke; and it was:</p>
<p>&#8220;Up, Lily! Get on your bike! Look alive!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the bloomers that Lily wore out! Ma was kept
busy in the dressing-room mending the rents at the knees
and patching the seats:</p>
<p>&#8220;What a tomboy!&#8221; Ma cried.</p>
<p>And this went on for months and months. And
then came Chicago; a visit of Pa&#8217;s to the agents; and a
contract with the New York Olympians, a variety-show
coming from the West and returning to New York by
Columbus and Pittsburg. And new people, new people;
stars of every kind: the Para woman, a rheumatic juggler,
who was obliged to change her turn and become an
exhibitor of performing parrots, a ragged, molting
troupe, picked up cheap at second-hand; an infant
prodigy who topped the bill, a boy-violinist, leading an
orchestra, too, at fourteen, a pretentious little humbug
trained to make a few movements, while others did the
work. Lily thought him so good-looking she simply
couldn&#8217;t take her eyes off him. And then she had some
big girl-friends who had had love affairs! They were
the Three Graces, gymnasts endowed with bodies like so
many Apollos, honest German faces and a bewildering
amount of strength, pluck and precision....</p>
<p>&#8220;What smackings that must have taken!&#8221; thought Pa.</p>
<p>But no, their uncle and manager, Mr. Fuchs&mdash;a name
as famous in its way as Martello&#8217;s&mdash;was known for his
gentleness and adored and coddled and pampered by the
Three Graces, who, at a sign from &#8220;Nunkie,&#8221; as they
called him, joyously rushed to practice, taking a pride in
pleasing their dear Nunkie.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old rogue!&#8221; said Pa enviously. &#8220;He has an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
easy time of it; whereas I, with my skinny kitten, damn
it ...!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, well, he mustn&#8217;t complain, as he himself admitted:
one more rung which he had mounted, thanks
to his Lily, that engagement with the best variety-show in
the States; nothing but big theaters: Orpheums! Dominions!
And New York next! And then London!
Things were moving, moving! And Pa looked lovingly
at his Lily, as she played at being grown up with the
Three Graces, in the train on Sunday, traveling from
town to town, while Ma was knitting things for her
tomboy. He talked to Mr. Fuchs as between equals, as
between man and man, as between the manager of a star
and the owner of a troupe; and the train rushed on, rushed
on, with an indistinct sound of the engine-bell, now and
again, when they crossed a street. Mr. Fuchs, heavy-jawed,
slow of speech, said that he had had enough of
traveling, at his age, if it were not for his dear nieces.
He would like to retire to the country, to his little home,
and grow his roses, as soon as he had married off his
dear nieces, which would not be long, no doubt. As it
was, one of them, Thea, the one who did five pullings-up
with her left hand, had his permission to receive letters
from her sweetheart, a young man at St. Louis, quite
well-off. The idyl made good Mr. Fuchs blossom into a
genial smile: family life! Simple joys! The only true
ones! Worth more than the stage! And Nunkie talked
and talked: the Parisienne, a perpetual scandal! And
wait a bit: what was that he heard at an agent&#8217;s the other
day? Yes, the daughter of his old friend Martello, Ave
Maria her name was, had left her brother, and run away
from Mexico with a man! Tut, tut, the things one saw
nowadays!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>Pa hardly listened to the old crock, preferred to dream
of New York and the success his Lily would achieve
there! And Lily, sitting close by, listened with all her
ears, puckered her little forehead: love, love....
And Ave Maria, who had run away with a man....
Why with a man? And she squeezed up against Thea,
the Grace who was in love ... put question after
question.... She talked of her boy-violinist, of
Trampy. And they all laughed boisterously, with heads
thrown back, full-throated, and Nunkie, very paternally,
congratulated Mr. Clifton on his daughter&#8217;s niceness.</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake, don&#8217;t go putting it into her head
that she&#8217;s pretty, the little devil!&#8221; protested Ma. &#8220;That
would be the last straw!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The arrival in New York was a disappointment to Pa.
The authorities insisted on seeing the papers this time.
Lily was under age; just as at &#8217;Frisco. What! Why?
Because of former scandals, it appeared: Martello and
Ave Maria. What had he, a British subject, to do with
those Dagoes who spoil the profession? growled Pa. He
ended by rebelling against the injustice of it, thought of
the Three Graces hard at work rehearsing under Nunkie&#8217;s
eye, while he, Clifton, had not even the right to set foot
on a stage and let Lily practise there. To work, to work,
damn it! And he locked her up all day in her room doing
her balancings, the boomerang on the front wheel, the
standstill on the back-wheel, or the bike upside down,
with Lily standing on the pedals, like a convict on the
tread-mill. The pack of fools! Because a Dago had
whipped his sister, wasn&#8217;t a Pa to have the right to bring
his own daughter up? To work, to work! And he kept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
her at it for hours and hours, watched and knit his brows,
like a sage pondering for hours over the solution of a
problem.</p>
<p>Lily, breathless, would turn a look of entreaty upon
her Ma, but Mrs. Clifton, with her nose bent over her
work, pretended not to see, obstinately went on cutting
out, patching, sewing her tomboy&#8217;s bloomers. Lily longed
for Trampy....</p>
<p>At night, Pa ran from theater to theater: from Fourteenth
Street, where they lodged, to Twenty-third Street;
took the elevated to Fifty-eighth Street, to Hundred
and-twenty-fifth Street! All theaters at which Lily
would have triumphed but for those dirty Dagoes!
And the things that were served up to the public, pooh!
Clifton laughed with scorn. Troupes of English dancing-girls&mdash;the
famous Roofers&mdash;with movements like stuffed
dolls; and cyclists, pooh! Hauptmanns, fat freaks turned
out in Berlin: if that was the best they could do, pooh!
Oh, if he had only had the right to send his New Zealander
on Wheels scooting in among their legs, just to
show the public what a star really was! And all the
morning he ran about the town talking of &#8220;childish tricks&mdash;a
big girl&#8221; to the police and &#8220;wonderful tricks&mdash;the
only girl of her age who can do them&#8221; to the agents in
the St. James&#8217; Building. Oh, if he could have London!
He longed to measure his strength against all those famous
names&mdash;Marjutti, Laurence, the Pawnees&mdash;just to
show them his Lily!</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>And now it was the last stage. All around stretched
the dark sea; and the liner sped&mdash;thud, thud, thud&mdash;through
a gloomy set. Three days more and then Liverpool;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
and London at last! Pa was about to realize
his dream. He had signed, at last, for the Castle, in London!
It was all right, it was all right! Prospects fine!
And Harrasford was on board; it seemed a sign of good
luck! He was traveling with his architect. Harrasford,
the great English manager&mdash;Pa knew them all by name&mdash;Harrasford,
the man for whom a whole nation of &#8220;artistes&#8221;
toiled and moiled nightly. Pa had caught a glimpse
of him.... He would have liked to introduce his
Lily to him; no matter, he would know her one day, when
she was starring in his halls! And on the Bill and Boom
Tour! And elsewhere! She would soon be famous.</p>
<p>Ma, who remained lying in her bunk sucking lemons,
would have liked to have her Lily by her, within call, to
keep her mother company, that great big girl spoiled by
her Pa, even when she was not performing, as in New
York; ... a new cloak and boots and gewgaws ... a
couple of fools together, that&#8217;s what Ma
called them! And she needed watching, that tomboy,
who would break her leg one of these days, tumbling up
and down the companion-way. But Lily preferred to
enjoy herself and expended on running about the energies
which she no longer had to devote to her practising.
Her accumulated weariness disappeared under the influence
of the sleep and the good meals, which she had not
the boredom of having to get ready, as in Fourteenth
Street, where Lily, big girl that she was, had to help
her Ma.</p>
<p>She flitted all over the deck, munching candies,
showed everybody her new boots and her red cloak, held
her head high, was very proud of being looked at. Lily
dreamed of the Three Graces; of the boy-violinist; of
Trampy. She made conquest upon conquest, down to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
electrician of the ship, quite a young lad, who looked as
cold as ice.</p>
<p>She sometimes stopped at his door, watched him handling
levers, pressing buttons. It was like the switchboard
of a theater. She pointed to this and to that. The
lad smiled, told the New Zealander on Wheels all about
his little world....</p>
<p>As for Lily, she was going to star in London, where
her Pa would cover her with diamonds! And she went
on to tell him stories, like a little school-girl who has
read a book or two: India, two eyes glittering in the
dark, gee! And elephants she had known, little birds
which she had kept in a cage in Natal, and kangaroos.
The lion, who stands up on his hind legs when he&#8217;s angry;
and the tiger, who lies down flat. And parrots. And
starry nights in Africa: stars &#8220;that big.&#8221; And storms:
waves &#8220;miles high!&#8221; And successes at Gangpur; and in
Chicago, where she shared a dressing-room with three
girls who, when they were undressed, were all over
muscles, just like men. She liked the bike well enough,
but those falls: oh, damn it!</p>
<p>&#8220;That little monkey has seen everything in her time,&#8221;
thought Jimmy, the electrician.</p>
<p>And he mused upon the numberless things which she
had seen, the countries, the cities, and all that she would
yet see, in her life as a wandering star, while he would
remain walled up in his cabin, with his nose to the switchboard.</p>
<p>And the steamer sped&mdash;thud, thud, thud&mdash;over the
dark sea, where the noise of the waves sounded like the
roar of multitudes of men. Huge clouds in the east were
tinged with red, as though London were about to loom
above the horizon in all its glory, filling the vast expanse
with its rumors and its lights....</p>

<h2>CURTAIN RISES</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Lily ... who&#8217;s Lily? A New Zealander: really?
Ah well, we will look into the matter; it will be settled
later on ...&#8221;</p>
<p>Clifton, when he returned home that evening, gnawed
his mustache and clenched his fists with rage. Ah, he
would not soon forget his arrival in London! To get
there and be chucked! Was that what he had come from
New York for? To see Lily&#8217;s place at the Castle filled
by another troupe of the Hauptmanns&mdash;the Hauptmanns
again, those fat freaks!&mdash;and nothing to be said or done?</p>
<p>&#8220;Engagement not valid. Ought at least to have waited
for the London agency&#8217;s signed contract before leaving!&#8221;</p>
<p>Intent upon his vexations of the moment, he described
his day to Mrs. Clifton. What had staggered him, done
for him, was his visit to the agent, where they hadn&#8217;t
seemed to know Lily!</p>
<p>He had rushed at once to others, just to show them who
Miss Lily was! But he got the same reply wherever he
went:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily? Who&#8217;s Lily? A Maori? Let&#8217;s see the photograph.&#8221;</p>
<p>And would Mrs. Clifton ever believe, asked the indignant
Pa, what they said when they handed him back the
photograph? Yes, to him, the father, to his face, they
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s too thin, that Lily of yours!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
&#8220;If that&#8217;s the way they welcome British subjects returning
to the mother-country, it&#8217;s jolly encouraging, on
my word it is!&#8221; concluded Clifton.</p>
<p>Ma, among the open boxes, listened and said nothing;
she was exasperated. Their entry into the metropolis
struck her, too, as anything but triumphal. For all her
dislike of those breakneck trades, for all her contempt
for the bike, she displayed even more anxiety than Pa.
With those fat freaks at the Castle and if engagements
continued scarce, how would they manage, later on, lost
in that huge London, with no money, and a child to feed?
Her vanity was wounded as well. She had dreamed of
dazzling her sister-in-law, making them all burst with
jealousy over the splendid engagement at the Castle; and
now everything was slipping from their hands, on the
very day of their arrival, and there was nothing for them
but to sit at home and keep quiet.</p>
<p>But Pa, the next day, tore through London like one
possessed, grinding his teeth and clenching his fists, railing
at everybody, himself included. He thought of Lily,
who had lost a week on the voyage and who was now
messing about in the house, instead of practising her bike.
This idea pursued him, clung to him; but his perseverance
was indomitable, his courage ready to face anything or
anybody. Lily should perform at the Castle! She had
come to perform there and perform there she should!
There were more visits to the agents, to this one and
that one, to one and all, indefatigable visits. Clifton
insisted on his Lily&#8217;s merits, pulled out his pocket-book,
bursting with press-cuttings, offered to prove his statements.
The agent, on his side, had made inquiries.
Lily was very clever for her age: a little thin, it was true,
but very graceful; and the New Zealander on Wheels
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
ought to get on. Clifton would work up her turn, no
doubt. And, at last, Pa obtained a promise in writing&mdash;and
signed&mdash;of an engagement in eight months&#8217; time ... at the Castle, damn it!</p>
<p>An engagement in eight months was better than nothing;
but what to do in the meanwhile? It wasn&#8217;t the
money question that bothered him; Pa had money; but
Lily worried him: he wanted work for Lily, bike all the
time and hard at it. Now, London was closed to him;
he couldn&#8217;t let her perform in London before appearing
at the Castle; that was in the contract; and there was
nothing for the provinces.</p>
<p>His tenacity continued to do him good service. He got
a few offers, in the London suburbs; that could do him
no harm, he knew, though his Lily did appear at Dulwich,
Deptford or West Ham: who would think of going
there to discover that shrimp?... damn their impudence!
And meantime the shrimp would work and her
day would come, you pack of fat freaks, you!</p>
<p>Pa, on the whole, was satisfied. To show Lily, that
was all he asked for! He was quieter, now that she could
practise. And Lily, also, was delighted and relieved.
At first it was jolly, doing nothing; but to be always at
home with Ma had its drawbacks; only the other day,
because she had asked for a tam-o&#8217;-shanter with a feather
in it, like those she saw the little girls wear in the street,
she had nearly had a box on the ear, the extravagant little
beast, who would bring them all to the workhouse!</p>
<p>Better biking with Pa, from morning till night, and
only coming home after the show. Besides, away from
the work, Pa was nice to her: a packet of sweets here, a
bunch of violets there; and then there were the train journeys
out of London and back, over the roofs: all those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
little yellow houses, with white curtains, and those little
back yards, no bigger than that&mdash;real dolls&#8217; houses, all
alike&mdash;and such lots of little chimneys, such lots and lots
of little chimneys; and those gorgeous posters: Hippodrome,
Olympia, Bovril, mustard, elephants, the Hauptmanns.
Pa wouldn&#8217;t look at them, those fat freaks; but,
oh, if he had them here&mdash;and a whip&mdash;just for five minutes ... and the chance of saying a word or two!
To think that they were working at the Castle, while he
was puffing out to the suburbs! And he racked his brain,
as he traveled over the town&mdash;that town which he had to
conquer and which was veiled from him between-whiles
by the curtain of posters in the railway-stations, on the
hoardings, everywhere&mdash;again, again; and imperial
troupes and royal troupes, endless troupes, arrays of
pink tights, lines of legs uplifted amid a flight of scarlet
skirts, alternating with Sunlight and Van Houten and
national and colonial troupes, loud as a trumpet-blare
and with nothing behind them, he dared say....</p>
<p>Those &#8220;troupes,&#8221; those &#8220;families&#8221;&mdash;he turned it all
over in his mind&mdash;yes, they judged talent by weight; the
public wanted a lot for its money: well, why shouldn&#8217;t
he have a troupe? Why not? Lily&mdash;he had noticed it
in the few shows she had given&mdash;Lily didn&#8217;t cut much of
a figure in London: five stone of flesh and bones, a mite,
a minnow, a nothing. Well, if Lily wasn&#8217;t enough by herself,
he&#8217;d give them more: a whole troupe, if need be!
Why, he&#8217;d set about it at once!</p>
<p>With his customary determination, yielding to a fixed
idea, he devoted himself to it. And, in the halls, at the
agents&#8217;, in the bars, at the Internationale Artisten-Klause
in Lisle Street, that universal meeting-place, Pa, ever on
the watch, strove to make people talk, listened with all his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
ears, took notes. It was very difficult to get at the real
facts; one had to ferret them out; the owners of the
troupes jealously concealed their methods, endeavored to
put you off, talked of apprentices at five or six shillings a
day, plus food and expenses. Pa saw through these tricks
and, to arrive at the truth, discounted the six shillings
down to sixpence. Lily, her Pa&#8217;s own daughter, easily
obtained information from the apprentices themselves
which she afterward repeated to him. He studied
<i>The Era</i>, the paper of the Profession, got the names
by heart: the managers, the &#8220;Pas&#8221;, the &#8220;bosses&#8221;, the
&#8220;profs.&#8221; He got acquainted with some of them personally.
Old Martello, for instance, the father of Ave Maria and
the &#8220;Bambinis.&#8221; Martello could have given Pa hints; but
he no longer interested himself in anything except his
Bambinis, whom the poor man, grown calm with age and
overwork, was now spoiling. The rest left him indifferent;
he hardly listened, spoke in short sentences, like a
man too old to care:</p>
<p>&#8220;Train apprentices? What&#8217;s the good? Run a troupe?
Pooh, madness!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pa thought this exclusive admiration very touching,
but it wasn&#8217;t what he wanted and, madness or not, damn
it, he was resolved to carry out his idea to the end!</p>
<p>There were imperial and royal troupes, &#8220;Risleys,&#8221; carpet
acrobats, pyramids of tumblers, some of them undergoing
an apprenticeship of cuffs and thumps. Pa was not
interested in these methods, did not approve of them; he
had never knocked Lily about, never let her fall on purpose&mdash;&#8220;Have
I, Lily?&#8221;&mdash;whereas in the imperial and
royal they sent the apprentice sprawling on his back, just
to teach him, when he started wrong.</p>
<p>Still, all these were boys; and it was the little girls that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
interested him, for he meant to have only girls among
his apprentices. The rest wasn&#8217;t his damned business;
but the different troupes of Roofer girls, for instance,
affected him directly: where did old Roofer fish those
girls out? That&#8217;s what Pa wanted to know. He had
even, in order to visit the school, pretended to bring Lily
as a pupil. He had seen the place in Broad Street, where
they turned out &#8220;sisters&#8221; by the gross; had watched the
squads in knickerbockers, scattered over the immense
room, like recruits drilling in a barrack-yard: groups engaged
in club-swinging, juggling, clog-dancing, all together,
a tangle of different movements timed &#8220;one, two,
three!&#8221; Roofer chose among the heap, sorted out the
sizes, called this lot the Merry Wives, that lot the Crazy
Things, christened them after an insect or a flower,
packed them up in lots of ten or twelve girls, with snub-noses
or Greek profiles, as preferred, despatched them,
carriage-paid, C. O. D., with words, music and muslin
skirts complete, and received every day a detailed account
of his Honeysuckles and Bees, scattered all over the
world, from the Klondike to Calcutta.</p>
<p>This superlative organization produced upon Pa the
effect of a state affair; it was something beyond him,
above him; it interested him especially from the recruiting
point of view; and what stimulated him above all was
the troupes of trick cyclists. He had seen plenty of them
in America, but then, wholly occupied as he was with
his Lily, they did not interest him, whereas now he was
seeking to fathom their lives, so that he might know.
Some of them, who went cheap, slept three in a bed,
niggers and whites all mixed; others, who were well
paid, lived easily and comfortably and put themselves
forward with less work and for more money than Lily,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
Lily who possessed artistic talent, and who had toiled
harder than all the rest of them put together! Patience,
his turn would come ... when she was a bit less
thin. And he would have the troupe of troupes, he&#8217;d
show them, jolly soon!</p>
<p>Mrs. Clifton was terrified at her husband&#8217;s boldness,
but dared not protest; however, she observed that it was
a big undertaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall have five apprentices,&#8221; interrupted Clifton,
&#8220;six including Lily. We must find lodgings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, dear...!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think...?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the apprentices, he would see to that to-morrow.
Ma suggested that her sister-in-law&#8217;s daughter might
do, but Pa wouldn&#8217;t have relatives at any price&mdash;blubbering
for a smacking bestowed upon their daughters&mdash;he
knew all about them, thank you. Let such sheep bleat
elsewhere. No, give him strangers. He could be freer
with them and get as many as he wished. An advertisement
in <i>The Daily Mail</i>&mdash;&#8220;Wanted, young girls for trick
cycling,&#8221; followed by the address&mdash;fetched them the same
day. The pavement before the house was blocked with
white aprons, sailor-hats and tam-o&#8217;-shanters. There
were consumptive-looking girls, long hanks of girls,
chunky girls, all crowding outside the door, until the
landlady drove them away with her broom and threatened
to do as much for Pa and Ma if all the street-arabs of
London were to go on soiling her nice white steps.</p>
<p>Pa, for that matter, found nothing in the bunch, not
one in twenty that was any good; or else they made exhorbitant
demands&mdash;two shillings a day those guttersnipes
expected&mdash;as though shillings were to be had for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
the asking! But why look so far? There were girls,
sometimes, at the back entrances of the theaters: stage-struck
kids who devoured Lily with their eyes and looked
at Pa as though to say, &#8220;Take me, take me!&#8221; That&#8217;s
what he wanted, damn it, girls who had the business in
their blood and
who wouldn&#8217;t
go whining over
a professional
slap or two,
which he dared
say he&#8217;d have
to distribute to
make up for lost
time.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='captionc' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 247px;'>
&#8220;TAKE ME, TAKE ME!&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The first girl
whom he engaged
he had already
seen gazing
ecstatically
at Lily, as they
left the theater,
far away down
the Mile End
Road, and he
saw her again,
one morning, in
front of his
house in the very heart of London! He could not believe
his eyes. She must have followed his scent, slept on the
threshold like a lost dog. Her Pa? Gone away. Her
Ma? Dead. Her name? Maud. Her age? Didn&#8217;t
know. Born somewhere in the immensity of Whitechapel,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
towheaded, round-faced. Nothing to eat for two
days. She&#8217;d do! He would go to the police-court, get
the license later; meantime, he netted her and that was
one!</p>
<p>As regards the others, he had to make a selection. He
chose them by preference in families which were overstocked
with brats, so that one more or less, in the heap,
made no difference. He got one this way; that made
two! Next, a &#8220;local girl,&#8221; seized with ambition, came
and offered herself. Three! He found two others: a
little Beak Street shop-girl and a Shoreditch Jewess.
That made five. It did not take him long to judge the
girls. He gave them a few days&#8217; trial before signing a
contract; and what an anxiety for them, Mr. Clifton&#8217;s
final decision! If one trembled too much, was caught
holding Pa&#8217;s shoulder for no reason, for fear of falling,
or blubbered because of a scratch on the skin, her fate
was settled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pack up, my lady,&#8221; Pa would say quite calmly.</p>
<p>There was no getting out of it: off she had to go, before
dinner, and home she went, through the gloomy
streets, after a brief glimpse of paradise.</p>
<p>He had to replace some of them: they were slack; or
else, independent at times, they looked at him for the
least push, as if they would fly at his throat. He asked
himself whether he wouldn&#8217;t be compelled to get some
over from Germany or else to pick up on the highroads,
in the Gipsies&#8217; caravans, children with skins tanned like
donkeys&#8217;, a troupe of blackamoors on wheels, who,
perched up on the handle-bars of the bikes, would
have looked like cockroaches mounted as brooches,
damn it!</p>
<p>However, by dint of selection, he ended by having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
only good ones left; and then he made a contract in due
form with the parents for three years, or even five, such
was his faith in the future. A few pence a week to the
family, a few pence to the baggage herself: he to dress,
lodge and board her and engage to make an artiste of her.
Everything was provided for: during the training, just
the board and the rest; when she began to work, a shilling
a day in addition. Over and above, she would be looked
after by a lady, Mrs. Clifton. Was that all right? Both
parties signed; the girl was an artiste, became a New
Zealander.</p>
<p>They brought their little wardrobe: one spare chemise,
on the average, one pair of stockings; their only protection
against the weather was the dress they had on, a
factory-girl&#8217;s ulster and a tam-o&#8217;-shanter. Later on,
when performing, they would be entitled to a celluloid
collar, satinette knickers and pumps.</p>
<p>Pa, though at first he took one extra room and then
two in the same house and though he also made his apprentices
sleep three in a bed, Pa soon found himself
cramped. It would have been nice to have a little house
somewhere in good air, next door to the country. But
there was one thing which made Pa decide to remain in
the West Central district. Jimmy, the young electrician
with whom Lily used to chat on shipboard, had given up
traveling. Harrasford and his architect had noticed him
on board and the great man had engaged him to manage
the electric installation of his theaters. Jimmy had taken
possession of a lodging in Gresse Street, Tottenham Court
Road. He slept over the shop, which, for the rest, served
him rather as a place in which to keep the tools for his
outside work. Pa often ran upon him in the neighborhood
and had a nodding acquaintance with him which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
turned out to be useful, as Jimmy, being in Harrasford&#8217;s
employment, was more or less at home in the variety-theaters
and nothing was easier than for him to obtain
leave for Clifton to practise on the stage. This it was
that persuaded Clifton to settle in the west end. In any
case, it would be cheaper
than dragging the six
girls and himself daily
from one end of London
to the other. The house
in which he took up his
quarters, in Rathbone
Place, quite close to
Jimmy, was small and
dark, but not dear. The
upper story was occupied
by people who were
out all day and the basement
served as a lumber
room. They would feel
quite at home here ... with
no old sheep to
listen at the keyholes.</p>

<p class='captionc' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 254px;'>
TOM, THE SHOEBLACK<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>And then he would
have slept in the parks,
if necessary, anywhere, rather than waste more precious
time! His Lily, his troupe, before everything. What he
had to do was to get a move on. He went so far as
to engage a boy, a shoeblack at the corner of Oxford
Street and Tottenham Court Road for the rest of the
time, to attend to the bikes and the girls at practice.</p>
<p>Pa gave his mind to the gear, the expenses, the general
business. Ma saw to good order, to domestic discipline.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
It was no longer the quiet life of a Pa and Ma trotting
round the world in the company of their one and only
bread-winning star. As for Lily, the daughter of the
boss and manager, she owed a good example to one and
all. In the morning, with Maud, she went down to the
kitchen, lit the stove, made the coffee. Next, she carried
up the breakfast to Pa and Ma in bed, then distributed
their rations to the famished girls. And off they went,
all six of them, with Pa following at their heels.</p>
<p>The stage-door gave the apprentices a thrill the first
day they entered. The passage, gently sloping, tall and
wide, because of the scenery, smelt of elephants and
cheap scent. It was blocked with properties, with queer-shaped
cases, flat as a slab or round as a ball. There
were long, narrow boxes, for the horizontal bars; sometimes
a row of wicker coffins, with a ventriloquist&#8217;s figures
inside. And labels from everywhere&mdash;Melbourne, Chicago,
Berlin, Lisbon&mdash;and &#8220;Rlys.&#8221; and &#8220;S. S.&#8221; that made
you feel in the hold of a liner, off to foreign ports.</p>
<p>At the end, beyond an iron door, was the stage, very
dark, pricked here and there with electric lamps. There
were things that glittered with spangles. To the girls
it seemed like the Kingdom of Puss-in-Boots or Blue-Beard;
but to Lily it was an old story. She was a little
like the school-girl in the good days long past, for whom
the master was always waiting, cane in hand. The rest
she didn&#8217;t care about.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, huge as the stage was, there was not
always room to practise: ponies or elephants would
monopolize it for hours at a time. Or else, when Roofer
was supplying a ballet, he took up the whole stage, all
day long: Lily, secretly delighted, sat down modestly in
a corner, so as to be in no one&#8217;s way. Roofer made his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
collection of calves and ankles flutter about, followed
the new dances with an expert eye, throwing his hat
back on his head, mopping his forehead, grumbling, finding
fault:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t eat chocolates while you&#8217;re dancing, you, Eva!
Hi, you, Gwendolen!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, to emphasize his remarks, he threw his felt hat at
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Silly old ass!&#8221; thought Pa, with a grin. &#8220;To think
you can train artistes like that. You&#8217;ll use up fifty hats,
you old fool, while my belt remains as good as new!&#8221;</p>
<p>For that was now Pa&#8217;s system, the strap&mdash;&#8220;à la
Mexico!&#8221;&mdash;not that he used it often nor very hard; but
he terrorized Lily with it and the other girls were afraid
of it, too, though they never got more than the threat,
seeing that they were apprentices, who might have run
away if he had struck out.</p>
<p>All this did not prevent them from working with a
will&mdash;trot, trot, trot&mdash;when there was no Roofer on the
stage and no elephants or ponies: yoop, on to the bikes
and the fun began! The sight of Pa training his star
made the apprentices shake in their knickers. Lily was
to do everything and to do it very well: Pa ran after her,
in a never-ending circle, and, from the corner of his eye,
watched Tom, who held the girls and made them work,
upon his instructions; and when they got off their bikes
to wipe their foreheads:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo, Miss Woolly-legs!&#8221; said Pa sarcastically.
&#8220;Tired, eh? Dead, eh? Suppose you tried to get up
again ... and be quick about it! And as for you,
Tom, don&#8217;t let them fall, or I&#8217;ll catch you one on the side
of the head!&#8221;</p>
<p>For Pa already knew by experience that their little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
ladyships shirked work; that they shook with fright; that
they lost confidence after a bad fall; and that then it was
finished, nothing to be done with them: they&#8217;d let themselves
be killed sooner.</p>
<p>Maud, for instance, that Jonah, ever after one day she
had seen her blood flow, trembled before her bike like a
sheep that scents the slaughter-house. It was no use
Pa&#8217;s threatening her with his belt: she wouldn&#8217;t let herself
go, on the contrary, held on to everything, no matter
what, for fear of falling. He ought to have sent her
away long ago; he would pack her off that very night ... and made no bones about telling her so, that
Jonah!</p>
<p>Then Pa, giving Lily a rest, occupied himself with the
girls: taught them the principle of the standstill, of side-riding,
of the &#8220;swan,&#8221; of the &#8220;frog.&#8221; And,&mdash;quickly!&mdash;the
indefatigable Pa went back to Lily, made her begin
a trick ten times, twenty times over, so great was his
rage at the lost time, the elephants, the Hauptmanns,
Roofer. He pulled faces, clenched his fists:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you do as I say when I tell you, damn it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Pa, I can&#8217;t!&#8221; protested Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can, if you like,&#8221; said Pa, exasperated this time
and unbuckling his belt.</p>
<p>Crash! A heap behind him, a medley of limbs and steel
fittings! Maud, who was still trying, on her bike, startled
by Pa&#8217;s threatening movement, had fallen flat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maud again! That damned Jonah!&#8221; cried Pa, going
up to her. &#8220;Well, Miss Woolly-legs, do you mean to
stay there all night?&#8221;</p>
<p>But she did not move; and, when they had disentangled
her from the bike, Pa saw an eye that was quite red
and a little stream of blood trickling down her cheek.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s look!&#8221; said Pa anxiously.</p>
<p>A spoke sprung from the felly had scratched her eye.</p>
<p>It was a serious accident. Sprained wrists, barked
shins didn&#8217;t count; but a spoke in the eye.... Luckily,
Maud had no relations; there was no claim to be
feared: not a vestige of old sheep on the mother&#8217;s side.
Pa said all this to himself as he ran to the chemist, and
Lily consoled poor Maud as best she could, said that,
after all, it was part of the game: she&#8217;d know better another
time, eh? She&#8217;d be a great star yet, eh, Maud?</p>
<p>The poor maimed thing lifted her face to Lily, stammered
through her tears that it was nothing ... all
right again now ... Pa&#8217;s fault, with his belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a little thing like that!&#8221; said Lily, laughing.
&#8220;Fancy falling from your bike for that! Why, I&#8217;d rather
have twenty &#8216;contracts on the back&#8217; than lose an eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>For that was what it amounted to. Pa realized it, after
he had dressed the wound. Clifton&#8217;s mind was not at
ease: a glass eye was not a very difficult matter ... but,
who knows, some callous person might inform Harrasford,
who stood no nonsense on that subject. Fortunately
the artistes present had not paid much attention ... had hardly noticed anything, in the dim light of
the stage....</p>
<p>And soon after the New Zealanders were walking back
to Rathbone place with Maud in their midst, her head a
roll of bandages, leaning on Lily&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>It was a pathetic home-coming. Ma had told them
what would happen! That would teach them to take in
vagabonds from the streets. Mrs. Clifton thought that,
in a respectable house....</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Pa, dropping into the easy-chair in
the dining-room. &#8220;I&#8217;m worn out. If you&#8217;d been like me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
Mrs. Clifton, running after those Woolly-legs all the
morning&#8221;&mdash;and he pointed to the apprentices standing
round the table&mdash;&#8220;gee, you wouldn&#8217;t talk so much! I&#8217;ll
take Maud to the hospital this afternoon; it&#8217;s only a
trifle. Is dinner ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, then, all of you Woolly-legs,&#8221; said Pa
jovially.</p>
<p>Pa was sorry for poor Maud, as a rule, but he felt a
need to shed a little gaiety, to extenuate the accident as far
as possible, to turn it into a joke, so as to prevent his girls
from being panic-stricken. He talked of heads smashed
to a jelly, of legs in smithereens, of a bicyclist who had
had not one, but both eyes caught in the chain. As
for himself, when he was a small boy&mdash;that was in the
time when they brought up artistes, real ones, mind
you; not, as nowadays, on sugar and sweets; no, real
ones, on the whip and the stick, damn it!&mdash;why, the accidents
which he&#8217;d seen! Yes, he himself, to go no farther,
he could have shown them, here, there, there, here, damn
it, all over his body, scars deep enough to put your finger
in!</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? Frightens you, does it? Never fear,&#8221; added Pa,
in a good-humored voice, &#8220;that sort of thing won&#8217;t happen
to any of you Woolley-legs; a good Irish stew is better
than a kick of the pedal, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Pa, after a last cup of strong tea, dismissed the
girls, lit his pipe, threw himself into the easy-chair, with
his legs long out in front of him; but soon:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Maud, what is it? What are you crying for
now? I tell you, I&#8217;ll buy you a glass one,&#8221; said Pa, at
the sight of Maud, who blubbered silently and sat glued
to her chair instead of getting up to go.</p>
<p>Poor lost dog! Clifton, at the theater, had threatened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
to send her away. She knew what that meant: leaving
Miss Lily, losing those good meals....</p>
<p>Maud faltered something about packing up; pain in her
eye; not her fault.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what you want is to stay with us?&#8221; asked Pa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Maud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, stay! But no more bike; you shall be
Lily&#8217;s lady&#8217;s maid,&#8221; said Pa, puffing at his pipe.</p>
<p>It went down so well, as an effort of dry humor, that
Ma could not help laughing. But Mr. Clifton was talking
seriously. Then Ma, amazed, protested: what, a servant
in her house! A lady&#8217;s maid for Lily! He would
end by giving her the moon! And what would Lily do
all day? She&#8217;d sit twiddling her thumbs! Had Mr.
Clifton thought of that?</p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Clifton had thought of it. He was too tired
to explain his reasons; but take it from him, it was best
like that. Pa, in fact, feared lest that smashed eye might
prove a worry to him: the papers weren&#8217;t in order. He
had made no declaration to the police; there was the
Workmen&#8217;s Compensation Act.... Much better
keep Maud safe in the house, for a while ...</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily won&#8217;t sit twiddling her thumbs for all that, will
you, Lily?&#8221; continued Pa, smiling to his star.</p>
<p>A touch of the brush and comb, a stroll through the
streets with the girls, by leave of Pa, who wished Lily
to take the air, then home again, more housework....
The apprentices, who did not yet perform in
public, were sent to bed early, while Lily, escorted by Pa,
went off to East, West, South or North London. An
hour to get there; then undress, dress, appear on the
stage under Pa&#8217;s eye, undress and dress again; another
hour to get back; a morsel of cold Irish stew, a cup of
tea; and drowsily up to her room and bed....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Lily!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma&#8217;s voice woke her with a start in the morning. Lily
dressed quickly and quickly ran down-stairs to the kitchen,
where Maud had gone before her; and it was the same
thing every day, except on tour, when discipline was less
strict. It had gone on for months and months, for two
years, ever since they came to London. Pa, with his iron
will, had overcome everything. He felt at home in the old
country, at last. After his engagements in the London
suburbs, he had obtained a triumph at the Castle, a Bill
and Boom tour of forty weeks, a season at Blackpool,
the Harrasford tour now, successes everywhere. Before
his boyish little girls, before his own particular troupe,
the fat freaks trembled in their knickers! For Clifton,
the new-comer, but yesterday unknown, it was an unhoped-for
success and fame and fortune.</p>
<p>Ma nearly always remained in London with Maud.
Lily was not big enough yet to need the supervision of
a Ma. Therefore, on tour,&mdash;when she was not practising
with her Pa,&mdash;Lily did the catering, saw to the porridge
and the Irish stew; Pa was not hard to please. Provided
Lily was &#8220;great&#8221; on the stage, he asked for nothing more.
Dishes burned for want of butter, salad mixed in the
wash-hand basin: he swallowed everything with an appetite,
ate standing, with his plate on the trunk, or else
seated with the girls round a little table hardly large
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
enough for three. This Bohemian life pleased him. He
loved youth, gaiety and good fellowship. He was fond
of a laugh, took Lily on his knee after dinner, played
with her, praised her home-made cakes, her tough chops,
and then began talking bike to Lily ... who hated
bikes, and who got something different from a hat flung
at her, when she missed a trick.</p>
<p>No matter, hard as it was, she preferred touring to
staying in London. The work was the same, but, at
least, it was a change. She was spoiled by every one,
down to that landlady who cried when she left....
After all there were many worse off than she, everlastingly
set about by &#8220;profs,&#8221; confined to their rooms all
day to practise their balancing; she had had a taste of it
in New York; no, thank you! She preferred having
good times with the girls, practical jokes, boxing-matches
even, scrimmages, pillow-fights. In the boarding-houses,
they flirted with the boys; they kept pet
pigeons, white mice, a lizard; they exchanged secrets,
stories of every country, professionals all! Sometimes,
they consoled one another; promised to send
kisses&mdash;x x x&mdash;on post-cards. And then there were new
faces, always; a week in each town, no longer; a real
life of adventure from one end of England to the
other. Now it wasn&#8217;t like that in London; she felt less
free there. Ma was particular and hard to please; there
were no pillow-fights, no romps; Ma hated those ways.
The stage, yes, she put up with that because it was Lily&#8217;s
profession; but one came in contact with all sorts there;
and that little devil of a Lily was wicked enough already!
It took all the home influence to thwart the bad examples
which she received outside; and it was Ma&#8217;s business to
see to it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>The house in Rathbone Place had been smartened up.
There was a dining-room which was used only for meals
and which never had a bed put into it at night. There
were things on what-nots: little photograph-frames, loose
photographs, lucky charms, china cups; all shining and
bright, thanks to the adjunction of a lady&#8217;s maid, as Pa
called Maud, in his funny way. At first, after the accident,
it was terrible. Her natural awkwardness was made worse
by a glass eye; she could not tell one side from the other,
spilt the tea on the cloth, broke the crockery. Maud did
the heavy work, washed and scrubbed all day long.
When the girls were in London, she went with them to
the theater, as dresser. Maud stood in the wings and
admired the New Zealanders whirling about in the light.
She stretched out her face in ecstasy toward Lily: that
Lily who had traveled everywhere, who was born so far
away, in a land full of monkeys and parrots. She followed
Lily to her dressing-room, trotted after her like a
dog, worshiped her open-mouthed.</p>
<p>Lily had ripened out, was becoming more beautiful,
more of a woman daily, despite the fact that her Pa still
treated her like a kid. She no longer looked at things
from the point of view of the child-girl who had been
delighted with a satin hair-ribbon in India; now her
pride was not appeased with such trifles. Ma, according
to Lily, seemed ashamed of her, dressed her badly: an
odd skirt here, an odd frock there, of a cheap make.
That was not what Lily wanted. She was an artiste: she
wanted a hat with big feathers and a gown with gold
braid to it; but, when she showed Ma a dress which she
liked in the shop windows, Ma would exclaim:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want with that? My poor Lily, you
must be mad! That&#8217;s for rich little girls, girls who have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
time to be pretty; it wouldn&#8217;t suit you at all. Why, if we
listened to you, we&#8217;d soon be in the workhouse!&#8221;</p>

P.T. CLIFTON, MANAGER<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Ma always said no, pretending that she had no money;
whereas Lily knew to the contrary. She knew that the
troupe earned a great deal and that the troupe was herself.
The other day, at the
theater, she had heard her
aunt, who felt bitter that
Mr. Clifton had not accepted
her daughter Daisy&mdash;who
could have learned
the business and later on
have starred by herself!&mdash;she
had heard that &#8220;old
sheep&#8221; say, speaking of
her:</p>
<p>&#8220;What a shame to dress
her like that! A girl who
brings them in capital to
invest!&#8221;</p>
<p>So Pa was investing
capital. She didn&#8217;t exactly
know what investing capital
meant; no doubt it
meant making a lot of
money. She asked for
none of it! Children belong
to their parents! But
she would have liked to be
treated with more consideration, to be spoiled; to get
presents, nice things. She had plenty from her Pa, true
enough: presents, my! But they were cheap gifts, for
all that.... She was always having promises made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
her of more important things; and the promises were
never kept: that big gold watch, for instance. She had
a thirsting for luxury. It seemed to her that she was
being treated like a performing dog, not a bit better.
Ma, without exactly knowing, but with an infallible instinct,
saw all this budding under that obstinate brow.
Mr. Clifton might see nothing in it; but it was not so
easy to take in a mother! Was there a love affair beneath
it all, Ma asked herself. No, not yet; it might
come later on, as with that apprentice who had run away,
or that other one whom she had had to send packing for
being too free with men. But Lily would not leave them
like that.</p>
<p>She did not let her go out. &#8220;Glass-eye Maud&#8221; ran the
errands and Lily stayed at home, like a good little girl
of whom her mother wished to make a lady. When she
did happen to go out, she must not be long, or else it
was, &#8220;Where have you been? Tell me at once!&#8221; At the
theater, when Pa lost his temper, she could reckon on a
mighty fillip, and then it was over: Pa was sorry, rather
than otherwise. Ma, on the contrary, would nag for
hours; muttered inarticulate phrases about &#8220;devil,&#8221;
&#8220;wild bull,&#8221; and &#8220;taming her;&#8221; there was no end to it.
Lily champed the bit! A star, indeed! Was that being
a star? She thought differently! She had seen others
drive up to the theater in their motors, accompanied
by gentlemen carrying flowers, like that famous &#8220;M&#8217;dlle&#8221;
at the Palace. Yes, those were stars: they dined at the
Horse Shoe and did not spend their time in useless
housework. Oh, she was quite sick and tired of that life!
She&#8217;d had enough of it. Meanwhile, the days passed
and the weeks and it was always the same thing: housework
and stage-work; work, work, work....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>It was late that morning; they were not practising.
Pa had run down on the previous day to see a troupe of
cyclists, the famous Pawnees, who were back from the
Continent, on their way to New York, and performing
that week at the Brighton Hippodrome. Lily was in her
room later than usual, as Ma was not awake. Maud
had gone down to the kitchen. The apprentices were
getting up, joking with one another, like tom-boys used
to sharing the same bed at home, the same room at the
theater, to dressing, undressing, splashing about naked
in the same bath-tub.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up, Lily,&#8221; said one of them, laughing and raising
her sturdy little hand. &#8220;Get up, or....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Lily, &#8220;let me alone, I&#8217;m dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it happened, on the day before there had been a
general tumble, six in a row, on the back-wheel; one of
them, losing her balance, had dragged the others with
her and the lot had fallen flat in a tangle of steel and
flesh. Bucking Horse, Old Jigger, Street Donkey&mdash;the
nicknames they gave their bikes&mdash;had kicked them to the
raw. They showed one another the bruises on their
limbs: &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t it hurt, just!&#8221; &#8220;What about mine?&#8221;
&#8220;Look here!&#8221; like young recruits bragging of their
wounds after the skirmish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Ma!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily washed quickly, put on her frock and ran
down-stairs to prepare the coffee, but her Ma stopped
her on her way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily, you light the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about Maud?&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t Maud
do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You young impudence,&#8221; ... said Ma; &#8220;Maud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
has gone to Jimmy&#8217;s to take the bike which Tom couldn&#8217;t
get to him yesterday; he was shut. It&#8217;s the bike you
spoiled, you little bedlamite!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily had to laugh at the thought of Maud struggling
with Old Jigger: Maud, who couldn&#8217;t lead the machine
by the handle-bar, or even walk beside it, without barking
her shins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; cried Lily. &#8220;She&#8217;ll explain everything wrong
to Jimmy, and the bike will be no use!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, go yourself,&#8221; said Ma, after a pause.
&#8220;And mind you, come back quickly; don&#8217;t go loitering in
the street; and don&#8217;t stay long with that drunkard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Ma.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gresse Street, where Jimmy lived, was quite as dreary
as Rathbone Place: here and there, a few posters on the
walls; some low-fronted shops, displaying sweets and
candies, or else a dazzling case of oranges on the muddy
pavement; alleys, stables, cab-yards....</p>
<p>It was here that Jimmy had his workshop, or rather
his tool-store, for he did not do much work there. The
time which his occupation at the theater left him he devoted
to improving himself. Electricity and its manifold
uses held his interest. There was no doubt that, had
he given all his time to it, he would have become very
clever, for he had an inventor&#8217;s brain and, moreover,
possessed an astonishing manual skill for altering and
perfecting things. He worked in copper and steel, was
glad to make and repair bikes for a few customers, the
New Zealanders, among others. While working, he
brewed all manner of plans in his brain. They all revealed
a practical intelligence. Saddle-supports which
reduced the shaking on a bike, improved carriage-springs
and so on; and, on the stage, inventions to dispense with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
men in the flies and wings; to work everything&mdash;scenery,
curtain, lime-light&mdash;by means of the switchboard;
and ever so many other things....</p>
<p>Since joining the theater, Jimmy had naturally undergone
the influence of the stage. It had affected his ideas,
with all its new-fangled &#8220;turns,&#8221; which owed their success
to a maximum of daring&mdash;or bluff&mdash;coupled with a
minimum of scientific knowledge: illusionists basing their
effects upon the reflections of invisible mirrors and the
cunning use of combined lights; &#8220;looping the loop,&#8221; &#8220;circles
of death,&#8221; in which sheer weight did the cyclist&#8217;s
work for him, his arrival at a given point depending
upon his accelerated and calculated speed. From seeing
so many of this sort scouring the world&mdash;erstwhile acrobats,
former laboratory-students, who now, venturing all
and risking all, topped the bills at the music-halls&mdash;Jimmy,
greatly interested in this scientific side, had himself made
researches in that direction. <i>Engineering</i> and other
journals had printed some of his schemes, including
that of an apparatus based upon the notion of exterior
ballistics: the resistance of the air proportional
to the square of the velocity and, according to this velocity,
the exact proportion of the angle of incidence to
the angle of projection. Theoretically, it was perfect; in
reality there might be some unexpected hitch. It was
a question for the venturesome performer, who allowed
himself to be projected by a series of powerful springs,
to fall accurately from pedestal to pedestal, preserving a
faultless balance; in a word, to risk his life six times in
as many seconds. The daring of a Laurence and the
agility of a Lily combined would not have been enough
for the task; and so Jimmy had prudently contented himself
with pinning his diagrams on the walls of the workshop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
and dismissing the idea from his mind. Not that
he was afraid, rather not; but simply because it appeared
impossible to him.</p>
<p>Other plans had interested him, besides; flying machines,
for instance, etc. He was a real enthusiast about
flying machines! One day, perhaps, when he knew more
... to say nothing of the theater, which did not
leave him much leisure; yet he managed, somehow, for
he took but little sleep and the rest of the time he devoted
to study.</p>
<p>This was the Jimmy of whom Ma made a bugbear to
Lily&mdash;in Lily&#8217;s interest&mdash;for he was one of the few men
whom she saw often; and you can never tell ...
with those devils of the stage....</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lily, as soon as she had turned the corner
of the street, drew herself up and, with a light step, went
down Percy Street and Tottenham Court Road, instead
of keeping straight on. It took her only five minutes
longer and it suggested luxury, fine shops, handsome
furniture, patent-leather shoes. She adored shopping,
even if it was only with the eyes, through the plate-glass
windows.</p>
<p>She loved to pass in front of the Horse Shoe, where
stars lived, real ones, not performing dogs. And
then, round a piece of waste land, there was a hoarding
covered with advertisements that interested her: the
Hippodrome, the Kingdom, the Castle were displayed between
extract of beef and mustard; and there were always
new programs; always new names; and elephants, horses,
lions; and tights....</p>
<p>Lily looked at this for a few seconds. And, suddenly,
she felt a thrill; on a scarlet poster, dazzling as the sun,
she read:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Great success! Trampy Wheel-Pad!! At the Kingdom!!!&#8221; Trampy
in London!</p>
<p>Not that Lily was astonished: it seemed to her quite
simple that he should be there, as simple as for her to
be in Chicago, Bombay or Capetown; people do sometimes
meet on tour, it all depends: you can be separated
for years and then perform at the same theater for months.
No, she was not in the least astonished: a little excited,
that was all, without exactly knowing why....</p>
<p>&#8220;But, if I should meet him,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;what shall I
say to him? What will he say to me? Will he think
me grown prettier or uglier?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily came to herself again and continued on her errand;
crossed Tottenham Court Road, plunged into a
labyrinth of blocked alleys, of dark courts, and, suddenly,
was at Jimmy&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Lily did not like him much; she considered him good-looking,
for a man, but too shy. He never paid her a
compliment. He seemed to think her ugly, whereas many
others admired her and made no bones about telling her
so, especially since the last few months; but he was
ashamed of himself, no doubt: a drunkard, as Ma said.</p>
<p>Poor Lily had no luck. She would have been so happy
to be courted, to relieve her boredom. But nothing
disgusted her so much as drink. And yet it didn&#8217;t show
in Jimmy. He always walked straight, never fell, like
that head-balancer who, the other night, had come tumbling
down from his perch. Besides, that one had an
excuse; he drank because he was crossed in love; to forget,
they said. Lily forgave everything the moment there
was love in it; but an icicle like Jimmy, who loved nobody
and who drank for the sake of drinking ... ugh!</p>
<p>Jimmy was at work when Lily entered. The small,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
dark shop, crammed with things in steel, with loose
wheels, queer-shaped objects, reminded Lily of a property
store, only it was dirtier. There were tools everywhere;
designs for machinery pinned on the walls; it
was all very ugly.</p>
<p>And Jimmy&#8217;s greeting was none too engaging either.
A curt smile&mdash;&#8220;Glad to see you, Miss Lily&#8221;&mdash;and, as for
the bike, he hadn&#8217;t understood a word of what the one-eyed
creature who had just left had tried to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought as much,&#8221; said Lily, laughing. &#8220;That&#8217;s why
I came.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, in a few words, she explained what she wanted.
First, repair the twisted frame; next, a slight alteration
for a new trick; a step here, another there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Always fresh tricks, Lily?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always, Jimmy. No end of bruises, I tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s part of the game,&#8221; said Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to see you try it,&#8221; retorted Lily contemptuously,
&#8220;squeezing through the frame while it&#8217;s
going, with that pedal barking your back,&#8221; and she rubbed
herself as she spoke. &#8220;Only yesterday I got a kick; gee!
It&#8217;s like those new tricks in which I don&#8217;t feel safe: riding
with one foot on the saddle and the other on the bar
and playing a banjo; it makes me shiver as I go past the
footlights; and Pa watching me, you know; and, if I lose
my balance, I get black and blue somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;One can&#8217;t expect a white skin
at the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily didn&#8217;t care for this. If she couldn&#8217;t be courted, at
least she liked to be pitied: that flattered her pride....
It was all very well for Pa to say, &#8220;It&#8217;s part of the game,
my little lady.&#8221; But that josser of a Jimmy, talking like
that at his ease!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not your daughter!&#8221; she said. &#8220;My!
You&#8217;d be harder than Pa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Pa is hard, sometimes; but he&#8217;s very fond of
you, for all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Lily, &#8220;he wouldn&#8217;t like me to break
my neck; I bring him in too much for that, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; interrupted Jimmy, &#8220;don&#8217;t talk nonsense. It&#8217;s
not right to speak as you&#8217;re doing. You&#8217;ll be sorry for it,
I&#8217;m sure. Tell me, rather: you were saying you wanted
a step here, another there; do you mean like this?&#8221;</p>
<p>And he rummaged among his tools, looked for loose
pieces, showed them to Lily, while thinking of other
things:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;do you think you&#8217;re the
only one that&#8217;s got to work? Suppose you were shut up
all day in a factory? Have you ever been to a factory?
Do you know the life of a metal-buffer girl at Sheffield,
standing in front of her wheel, from morning till night,
and work, work, work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not a work-girl, you great silly! You know
I&#8217;m an artiste! And, now, shall I tell you what I think of
you, Jimmy?&#8221; said Lily, pouting. &#8220;You&#8217;re a bad man,
that&#8217;s what you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>And thereupon she put out her tongue, turned her back
on him and began to look at the walls, the diagrams, the
drawings, an illustration out of <i>Engineering</i>.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>Jimmy, while handling the bike, gazed at Lily. There
was no sentimentality about Jimmy, but his lively
imagination made him see things through and through;
and, whatever he might be, Jimmy was not bad. That
little Lily: to think that, among all the girls of her own
age, she was the only one to do that trick! He pitied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
her and all child prodigies. To his mind, there was
something unsportsmanlike about it; something like a
race won by a one-year-old, with jockey, whip and spurs.
He did not believe all he heard, of course. He knew, he
lived with them, he was one of them. He knew the peculiar
mania of the music-hall, the instinctive lie, uttered
as if to discourage competition by giving it a fright at
the start. To listen to them, it meant the horsewhip, the
belt, all day long; going &#8220;through the mill,&#8221; all the time.
Among the people with the painted faces, it was a shot
at martyrdom, a chance for professional boasting. The
most commonplace, the most coddled lives were made
more interesting by means of imaginary wounds and
scars, like those explorers, in the books, who cross Africa
without food or drink, barefooted, with a crocodile snapping
at their heels.</p>
<p>He took good care not to exaggerate. Life in the halls
was no worse than anywhere else, thank God! It had
its good side and its bad side and its professional risks.
The &#8220;pros,&#8221; taking them all round, were as good as the
&#8220;jossers.&#8221; He wanted to be just. He had seen many
who were very happy; one could get anything done by
firm kindness. He could also understand, in the terrible
struggle for bread, that a man went on toiling hard
in the trade in which he was born. A pro could not make
a blue-stocking of his daughter; some were born duchesses,
on satin; others artistes on the boards. One trade
was as good as another; but dangerous practicings,
bruised flesh, seamed skins: no, he didn&#8217;t approve of that.
He had seen the Laurences, mad with ambition, beginning
all over again, in spite of falls calculated to stave in
the stage; had seen girls who &#8220;do knots&#8221; lying in the
dressing-rooms, gasping, exhausted. Even when professional
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
vanity alone prompted such excesses, Jimmy
protested within himself; and then there were so many
abuses.... Besides, the stage so often spoiled a woman: every
branch of the stage, from the highest to the
lowest. All that coaxing familiarity! What he said was,
if Lily had been his daughter, she should not be on the
stage; but there she was and he couldn&#8217;t help it; and, as
it was her natural place to be there, he would not be
guilty of the meanness of disgusting a poor girl with the
profession which she had been at pains to learn. He
preferred to let her call him &#8220;a bad man.&#8221; And that required
a certain courage; for it was no longer a child
talking to him, but an exquisitely pretty girl. Jimmy
could not believe his eyes. What a change! Was it
possible? Having been away from London, on Harrasford&#8217;s
service, he had not seen her for many months,
except the day before, just in time to shake hands behind
the scenes, in the dusk; but here, in his shop, he hardly
recognized her, he could not exactly say why. One thing
was certain: he had left her a child and he now found her
a beautiful girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tush!&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;She&#8217;s a child for all
that. Only, if she keeps on like this, what a handsome
woman she will be!&#8221;</p>
<p>That familiarity on the stage: he reproached himself
for thinking of it; it seemed to him an insult to Lily.
And he began to talk to her of different things, kindly
and pleasantly, changing from subject to subject. He
explained his drawings on the wall, his ideas: exterior
ballistics; the resistance of the air; risking his life six
times in as many seconds....</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s drunk,&#8221; thought Lily.</p>
<p>And, to stop this flow of words, as though talking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
to herself, Lily said she did not complain; no, she would
quite like the bike, if she hadn&#8217;t got to practise so hard;
she only complained that they didn&#8217;t treat her &#8220;fair&#8221; at
home:</p>
<p>&#8220;And look how I&#8217;m dressed! I&#8217;ve had the same toque
two years. And what do you think of this frock? The
material cost four-three a yard. I look like a tenter in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy did not share Lily&#8217;s indignation. He thought
her neatly and nicely dressed, in spite of her performing-dog&#8217;s
toque, as she said. It all suited her so well. But,
on examining that clear-cut little face, lifted toward
him with a rebellious air, he felt that the fatigue, even
the blows didn&#8217;t count; that the hardest thing, for Lily,
was to be &#8220;badly dressed;&#8221; that she would never swallow
that.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, look here,&#8221; said Jimmy, &#8220;all this isn&#8217;t worth
making a fuss for; you get cross about nothing at all;
when you came, you were all smiles; and now ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because,&#8221; Lily began, with a sly laugh&mdash;oh,
she was exasperated with Jimmy&#8217;s coldness! She&#8217;d show
him, the icicle, and have a bit of fun with him&mdash;&#8220;on my
way here, Jimmy, I met ... now you won&#8217;t give
me away, Jimmy? ... I met my ... sweetheart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A sweetheart? You? Lily?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes,&#8221; said Lily, nodding her head and looking
at him archly, for she could see, by Jimmy&#8217;s expression,
that he was caught.</p>
<p>&#8220;And your father and mother know nothing about it?&#8221;
insisted Jimmy, nonplussed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; it doesn&#8217;t concern them: at my age, a girl
earns a living for her Pa and Ma; I have as much right
to a sweetheart as any one else, I suppose.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>And, greatly amused, she fixed Jimmy with her mocking
eyes.</p>
<p>Jimmy stared at her in amazement.</p>
<p>Then she understood that it was not a thing to joke
about and that what she had just said was terrible. And,
suddenly:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not true, Jimmy! I was only laughing! Oh,
Jimmy, you&#8217;re going to give me away!&#8221; cried Lily,
squeezing Jimmy&#8217;s arm with a convulsive little hand.
&#8220;Oh, Jimmy, don&#8217;t tell Ma, please, please, Jimmy!&#8221;</p>
<p>And there was something so sincere in her voice that
Jimmy saw that she was speaking the truth, that it was
only the jest of a flapper used to the manners of the
stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said briskly, &#8220;I shan&#8217;t tell; don&#8217;t be afraid,
Lily; only ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s nice of you,&#8221; said Lily, much relieved.
&#8220;Marriage! If you only knew! And what would become
of the troupe? I shall never marry. I think....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, some day, it&#8217;s bound to come,&#8221; said Jimmy,
interrupting her. &#8220;You won&#8217;t spend all your life on a
bike. You are sure to marry some day....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me about marriage! No, not that.
Gee!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Love stories! With men! I! And you believed it,&#8221;
said Lily, drawing back her shoulder and raising her
hand. &#8220;I could smack you, you great silly!&#8221; And, all
of a sudden, &#8220;I must go,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I&#8217;ve stayed too
long; Ma will be waiting for me with her broom!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily rushed outside, without giving Jimmy time
to answer. He could just see her turn the corner of
the street.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>Jimmy went back to his work, silently, wrapped up in
his thoughts. That nice little Lily! She could be easy in
her mind. No, he would never be a cause of worry to
her....</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lily ran home as fast as she could and, on
entering, saw that it was no use; her Ma was waiting for
her, furious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve come straight from Jimmy&#8217;s, Ma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lie! The butcher&#8217;s boy, who has just left,
saw you outside the Horse Shoe. Who were you waiting
for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t waiting for any one!&#8221; cried Lily, her eyes
blazing with anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;You devil!&#8221; said Ma, looking round for a stick, an
umbrella....</p>
<p>And, when she saw nothing within reach, her anger
increased. Then she stiffened her arm and made for
Lily, who sprang behind the table....</p>
<p>But Ma, tripping on the carpet, fell at full length,
dragging down with her the table-cloth and two cups that
were on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;My two china cups! You viper!&#8221; she yelled.</p>
<p>At that moment, the door opened; Clifton entered.
He seemed preoccupied; looked at his watch:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nine o&#8217;clock. We ought to be at the theater! Where
are the girls? And what ... what&#8217;s all this?&#8221; he
asked, on seeing the disorder, Mrs. Clifton scrambling
up from the floor, Lily scowling in a corner.</p>
<p>Ma grunted an explanation. Two cups broken, Lily a
gadabout who would bring them to the grave with shame!</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Pa, I was only looking at the posters.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Posters?&#8221; repeated Clifton. &#8220;Which posters? What&#8217;s
all this nonsense?&#8221;</p>
<p>And, when Ma had told him, interrupted by despairing
&#8220;But, Pas,&#8221; and &#8220;No, Pas,&#8221; from Lily, he very calmly
asked, was he going to have peace in his own house,
or was he not? All this fuss about two broken cups;
beating Lily for nothing!</p>
<p>Never, in any circumstances, would Clifton have
snubbed Mrs. Clifton like this before Lily. He would
have waited until she had gone. But to come upon all this
rot when there were so many serious things to discuss!
The sisters Pawnee whom he had seen last night: Polly,
Edith, Lillian. Yes, that Lillian, damn it, a winged rose!
And the things they did on their bike without seeming
to touch it!</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor Lily,&#8221; Pa went on, going up to his daughter
and stroking her hair. &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying it to vex you;
but you&#8217;re not in it with the Pawnees! Come on! Beg
your Ma&#8217;s pardon; and let&#8217;s be off to the theater. I&#8217;m
in form this morning. We shall have a great practice.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>A few minutes later, Pa was hustling his herd before
him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Quicker, my Woolly-legs! No time to lose!&#8221;</p>
<p>He thought of the tricks which he had jotted down
the evening before in his note-book. Lily would learn
them quick enough: she was as clever as the Pawnees,
when all was said, only less graceful. She had the balancing
power all right; but grace, grace, damn it, to do
a thing like that as though it were child&#8217;s play: that&#8217;s
what she hadn&#8217;t got! You saw the effort. And the
apprentices had no precision in their groupings. Now
the fat freaks had. To combine German discipline with
English gracefulness, that was the question; to have the
troupe of troupes; to have a Lily who would be worth
more by herself than Polly, Edith and Lillian put together.
But that meant work and going through the
mill! This last made Pa think of the old sheep and their
bleatings. He gave a nervous little laugh and his hand
had a convulsive movement, as though to strangle those
pests.</p>
<p>Pa had recovered his good humor and was grinning
by the time they reached the theater. Merely by his way
of taking the key of his dressing-room from the stage-doorkeeper
one recognized the owner of a troupe, the
man with a &#8220;permanent address,&#8221; the manager, the boss,
the prof, the Pa. On entering the lobby, he, with his six
girls, took possession of the theater. He nodded to the
staff; growled a &#8220;Lazybones!&#8221; as the Roofers passed out
two by two, always two by two: a fair one with made-up
eyes, a dark one with kiss-me-quick lips; sniffed their
cheap perfumes amid the tarry smell of the packages
marked Sidney, New York, Paris....</p>

&#8220;QUICKER, MY WOOLLY-LEGS!&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>On reaching the stage, Pa first gave a glance to make
sure that there were no elephants, or ponies, or Merry
Wives, that they could practise at their ease, without
having to burrow in a corner, like rats. The stage was
almost empty. After the live street, it was a pallid light,
in which ghosts moved. The New Zealanders, it need
not be said, no longer fancied themselves in the cavern
of Bluebeard or Puss-in-Boots; they had seen too many
stages during the past two years. The slant of the floor,
the roughness or smoothness of the boards was what interested
them, for fear of falls and barked shins. Pa hurried
them to their dressing-room to get into their knickers,
while he took off his jacket and turned up his
trousers, so as to run better. No more time to lose,
with his Lily! He was still in a fever from seeing
those Pawnees last night. As for the stage and the
boards, a lot he cared, slanting or straight, rough or
smooth! To work! to work! And he got ready the
bikes, which Tom had brought down, without a glance
around him.</p>
<p>To a poet, to a painter, that glance would have been
worth the taking. The iron curtain was raised, the house
loomed vaguely; the balconies, covered with cloth, stood
out like cliffs; the pit, with its seats under a gray drugget,
because of the dust, lifted toward the stage its rows of
motionless waves. The stage itself was strange: a sort
of huge cave, with strips of scenery hanging like stalactites;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
near the wall, a metal pedestal, with a red velvet
platform, looked like a blood-stained scaffold; one suspected
the presence of properties: wheels, iron implements,
tangled ropes, like so many instruments of torture.
At the New Zealanders&#8217; feet, half-naked bodies, suggesting
the souls of the damned, were tumbling, practising
falls; a woman in a white wrap hovered round; and, near
the proscenium, a pack of trained seals, lying in their
moist boxes, raised their frightened heads, as who should
say corpses cast up on the shores of hell by the silent
waves of the pit.</p>
<p>But three slender forms, spinning on their trapeze
almost above Pa&#8217;s head, sprang lightly to the stage, near
an old fellow in spectacles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Fuchs and the Three Graces! Here&#8217;s a
surprise!&#8221; said Pa, who had not seen them since the
New York Olympians. &#8220;When did you get here? Yesterday?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a general shaking of hands. Fuchs congratulated
Pa on his success, said he had followed his
progress in the papers. Pa owned a troupe now and had
a name.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is your Lily,&#8221; said Fuchs, tapping her on the
cheek as she joined the group. &#8220;A real lady! And good,
eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Three Graces also congratulated Pa ...
kissed Lily:</p>
<p>&#8220;How sweet you&#8217;ve grown! Why, Lily, how pretty
you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily was so surprised, so pleased; and her Pa was very
proud. He thanked Mr. Fuchs, complimented the Three
Graces in his turn, to their delight:</p>
<p>&#8220;What arms! What muscles!&#8221; Then, &#8220;Excuse us,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
eh? Lily must get ready. We shall meet again presently,
after practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Graces had gone back to it already. Pa tested the
bikes; took a hurried turn at the pumps; and, when the
apprentices and Lily returned:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yoop, up with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The round began. Tom looked to the girls, constantly;
ran after them; kept an eye on their falls. Pa, constantly,
hung on to Lily. Nothing else existed when he
was handling his star. His wish to do well, his love of
art for art&#8217;s sake worked him up, stimulated him, made
him hit out but not in anger: it was the spark of enthusiasm,
of which the apprentices caught the reflection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, you there, Mary! I&#8217;ll pull your ear! Birdie, if I
take my belt to you!&#8221;</p>
<p>But his Lily above all; his Lily! his seven stone of
flesh and bones! Pa was an artiste; he had thought
of a thousand things since his trip to Brighton. New
and astounding tricks; and easy at that ... if
Lily only would! Oh, he&#8217;d soon make her graceful!
But, for that, she would have to obey, to let go the
handle-bar at a sign, instead of endlessly seeking her
balance. For instance, Pa held her rein to prevent falls&mdash;there
was nothing spiteful about Pa, he never let you
fall on purpose&mdash;and Lily&mdash;&#8220;One! Two!&mdash;Count together,
Lily!&#8221;&mdash;put one foot on the saddle, the other
on the handle-bar: &#8220;Three!&#8221; That&#8217;s where she had to
let go her hands, smartly, and stand erect as she rode.
The machine slipped under her. Lily, shaking with fear,
stooped to seize the handle-bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand up, Lily! Show pluck, Lily!&#8221; said Pa.</p>
<p>Lily, accustomed to obeying blindly, drew herself up
again. But, sometimes, crash! The whole came tumbling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
down. Notwithstanding the rein, Lily fell to the
ground; and the bike, in addition, caught her a kick in
passing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing broken? A tiny scratch; it&#8217;s nothing. Tom,
the white stuff!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom left his Woolley-legs, brought a bottle of embrocation;
a few drops of that on the skin, a bit of
sticking-plaster; there, that was all right.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Lily, you&#8217;re not dead yet! Nothing to be
frightened about. Come, try again!&#8221;</p>
<p>The great thing was to hustle. Pa displayed so much
enthusiasm&mdash;&#8220;Those Pawnees, damn it!&#8221;&mdash;that Lily, for
all her fears, was smitten in her turn, ended by becoming
exasperated against those Pawnees, felt a longing to
wring their necks!</p>
<p>She obeyed her Pa like an automaton, in her anxiety
to do well.</p>
<p>&#8220;More graceful! That&#8217;s it! Not so stiff!&#8221; said Pa.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Pa, I can&#8217;t!&#8221; protested Lily, soaked in perspiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve got to, my little lady!&#8221;</p>
<p>They passed from one practice to another, almost without
resting. Lily was worn out, Pa seemed indefatigable.</p>
<p>Sometimes, practising was marked by interruptions.
Maud&#8217;s gouged eye remained the typical accident. Another
time, a girl lay fainting for ten minutes after
falling on her head; or else the stage was invaded by a
ballet. There was no end to it. On this particular day,
they had a visit from Harrasford himself, Harrasford
the chief and master, who came along with Jimmy; a
visit which was the more sensational for being quite rare.
Pa, now that he was the owner of a troupe and sure of
his position, would not have been sorry to be noticed by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
Harrasford, just to impress Mr. Fuchs and show him
what they thought of Lily in London.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do your best, my Lily,&#8221; said Pa. &#8220;He&#8217;s watching
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>But bill-toppers, New Zealanders though they might
be, were nobodies to &#8220;him;&#8221; Lily&mdash;one of a thousand,
among all those of both sexes who performed in his theaters.
There might have been ten cycling rhinoceroses
on the boards; he might have seen Lily swallow her bike,
and change into a butterfly: he would have paid no attention.
Those were details that concerned the stage-manager.
He hurried across the stage to the fly-ladder,
made Jimmy explain things, took notes as he went,
wanted to see for himself, pointed to the first batten, to
the electric switches.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much for so many lamps? And that? What
does that come to, roughly?&#8221;</p>
<p>And he stopped for a second in his course, his ear
stretched toward Jimmy to catch his answer flying; then
both of them went on again, quickly.</p>
<p>Jimmy was now following Harrasford along the
bridges, with the whole stage below him, in the ruddy
semi-darkness; at one side, the half-naked bodies fell
with a heavy thud after their somersaults; or else it was
the sharp sound of a bike skidding; and distant voices
rose up to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Pa, I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve got to, my little lady!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little thing!&#8221; thought Jimmy, disappearing in
the flies, toward the side-rails, at Harrasford&#8217;s heels.
And Lily went on riding and Pa running after her,
round and round and round. She seemed to be fleeing
madly, pursued by a devil. Suddenly, Pa stopped,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
having exhausted his strength, and Lily fell rather than
sat upon a hamper by the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Lily, put this over your shoulders,&#8221; said Pa,
giving her his jacket. &#8220;You&#8217;ll catch cold, darling. Oof,
let&#8217;s take breath a bit!&#8221;</p>
<p>But a glad voice burst through the silence: it came
from the Three Graces, who always worked on stubbornly,
even during the absence of Nunkie, who had been
out for a smoke. Thea greeted his return with a cry of
triumph:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten pullings-up with one arm, Nunkie! Ten without
stopping!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well done! I&#8217;m very pleased with you,&#8221; said Mr.
Fuchs; and he crowned their excitement by declaring
that, as a reward, he would that very day buy Thea the
sleeve-links which he had promised her ever since last
year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Nunkie!&#8221;</p>
<p>A spasm of vanity made them rush back to their work;
and soon the three of them formed, in mid-air, an involved
group of ropes, bars and hardened limbs.</p>
<p>Lily, in spite of her fatigue, was amused at those mad
girls. To take all that trouble for the sake of a pair of
sleeve-links! Her shoulders shook with nervous laughter,
in spite of Pa&#8217;s presence. He quieted her with a gesture,
scolded her under his breath, kindly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, Lily!... Aren&#8217;t you ashamed of yourself,
Lily?&#8221;</p>
<p>And he looked at Nunkie with an air of saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;You old rogue!&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the Three Graces, it was a pleasure to watch
them: their pluck was infectious.</p>
<p>&#8220;To work!&#8221; said Pa. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a somersault, eh?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>And, at a sign from him, two of the apprentices, assisted
by Tom, fixed a little steel-legged table in the middle
of the stage, bore down upon it with all their weight.
The bike, set at full speed, stopped short as it struck the
table; and Lily, carried on by the impulse, continued her
whirl, full on her back, and, carrying the machine with
her, came to the ground on the other side of the table and
went on riding. But that shook her, in her stomach, her
heart, everywhere. Each time, she was nearly succeeding,
but it wasn&#8217;t quite right.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see,&#8221; said Pa, &#8220;you want to make me lose my
temper!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Pa, it hurts!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, those blasted little brats!&#8221; shouted Pa angrily.
&#8220;Rickety machines, every one of them: no more energy
than a sparrow and lazy into the bargain!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, Lily succeeded magnificently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see you can do it when you like, you obstinate
little wretch!&#8221; said Pa. &#8220;Now try not to miss it again,
next time! That will do for to-day,&#8221; he added, seeing
Lily out of breath. &#8220;Go and get dressed, my Lily.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Three Graces were finishing also. Good old
Nunkie wiped the perspiration from their foreheads
with his big checked handkerchief, invited Clifton to
come with Lily and choose the sleeve-links and suggested
that they could have a chat at the restaurant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to, Lily?&#8221; asked Pa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Pa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls would go back alone. Tom, having carried
up the bikes, was told to run home and fetch Miss Lily&#8217;s
new dress and boots, Mrs. Clifton&#8217;s brooch and big hat.
And, half an hour later, Lily, who had crawled up to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
dressing-room stiff-legged, exhausted, feeling sixty, came
tripping down the stairs all freshly dressed, wearing the
great hat of her mother, and a pair of creaking boots.
She soon recovered when she was dressed out. She
drew up her dainty figure, so as to be level with the imposing
group of Pa, Nunkie and the Three Graces.</p>
<p>Lily, very proud of herself, spun out the pleasure of
drawing on her gloves to go shopping with those big
girls, who had had love stories. Then they discussed
what restaurant.... Nunkie, long ago&mdash;&#8220;Zæo&#8217;s
year at the Aquarium:&mdash;that doesn&#8217;t make me any younger,
eh?&#8221;&mdash;had discovered a little German place....</p>
<p>Lily would have liked to propose the Horse Shoe, to
walk in there with her big hat and creaking boots as
though the place belonged to her. But they decided upon
a &#8220;Lyons&#8221; in Wardour Street. At the table, it was touching
to watch the attentions which the Three Graces lavished
upon their Nunkie, the respect they showed him.
Pa was not sorry that Lily should see that, but Lily took
no notice at all: she just removed her gloves, held her
knife and fork with the tips of her fingers, let Pa help
her, thanked him with a pretty &#8220;&#8217;K you.&#8221; From the corner
of her eye, she watched other groups, to pick up good
manners. She seemed to have frequented smart restaurants
all her life: beside her, Nunkie and the Three Graces,
who cut their bread with their knives and made a noise
when eating, looked like a family of small farmers on a
visit to London town. Pa was greatly amused, enjoyed
his daughter&#8217;s aristocratic ways, admired her refined air.
When they went out, in obedience to a look from Lily,
he bought her a bunch of violets, which he pinned to her
bodice himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Lily, are you happy? Do you love your Pa?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
Tell me you love your Pa,&#8221; and he looked at her gently
as if in regret at having been so harsh at practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s for your good, my Lily, you&#8217;ll thank me one of
these days. I&#8217;ll give you lovely dresses, I&#8217;ll cover you
with diamonds!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not to-day?&#8221; asked Lily, with a comic pout.</p>
<p>Then both of them laughed and Lily forgot everything,
even the blow with the fist, at being treated so like
a lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I was married,&#8221; she said to the Three Graces, &#8220;I
should like to go shopping all day long and have fine
dresses, a gold watch and no bike!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Three Graces, with their heroic strength, had no
thought of such luxuries. Thea told Lily of her successes
in America:</p>
<p>&#8220;Five pullings-up with one arm at Boston. Six at
&#8217;Frisco. Eight when we got back to New York! Eight,
Lily! And to-day....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your lover in America, tell me about your lover
...&#8221; interrupted Lily, pressing Thea&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk low,&#8221; said Thea, looking back at Nunkie, who
was walking behind with Pa. &#8220;Nunkie is furious with
him. If he ever meets him! He says it&#8217;s disgraceful,
not writing to me, after asking leave to. It&#8217;s an insult
that ought to disgust me with men for good and all,
Nunkie says.&#8221;</p>
<p>She told Lily everything, her unhappiness at first, for
she loved him. Lily, with her little nose in the air,
sniffed those love stories, gulped them down, so to speak,
with an instinctive movement of the lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;And did you write to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote to him, but he never answered. Oh, if Nunkie
knew! He forbids us to write, because writing, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
know, Lily, puts out the muscles of the arms, interferes
with the pullings-up, Nunkie says....&#8221;</p>

NUNKIE<br />

<p>But they turned into Regent Street: to Lily it
was the entrance to the paradise of shops. The huge
curve displayed its window fronts; and ladies and gentlemen
and little girls: not
dressed in their Ma&#8217;s leavings,
these last, but a superior
branch of mankind, similar to
that in the front boxes.</p>
<p>Nunkie blinked his eyes behind
his spectacles: all this
luxury terrified him; he had
almost forgotten the sleeve-links,
talking with Clifton of
people they had known:</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy-violinist? Not up
to much. Ave Maria? A disgrace:
married, deserted, I
don&#8217;t know what. Poland, the
Parisienne? A scandal!&#8221; As
for him, he had but one wish,
after getting his girls married:
to retire to his home,
grow his roses, look after his
pigeons; simple joys, the only
ones....</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Thea!&#8221; Lily broke
in, pointing through the plate-glass
to a heap of imitation
jewelry, lying, among watches,
on red and black velvet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; said Mr. Fuchs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>But, when Thea saw the prices&mdash;ten shillings, twelve
shilling&#8217;s&mdash;she refused to go in, saying she could have it
just as pretty in Wardour Street and ever so much
cheaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you please, my darling. I&#8217;ll do whatever you
like. I don&#8217;t know anything about it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Clifton felt something rise in revolt within him, he was
unable to resist it; a case of showing that old curmudgeon
what a Pa was and that his little girl, too, did pullings-up
in her way and that he knew how to treat her as a Pa
should:</p>
<p>&#8220;Your watch, Lily,&#8221; he said, opening the door and
pushing her in. &#8220;Now&#8217;s the chance to get it. Come,
choose for yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Pa! Do you really mean it, Pa?&#8221; she said incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here, I&#8217;ll smack you, Lily! When your Pa
tells you a thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily seemed a princess, with her way of saying,
&#8220;&#8217;K you,&#8221; of touching the ornaments, the watches, like a
little creature thirsting for luxury and yielding to her inclination
at the first opportunity. There was so great a
look of happiness in her eyes; and Clifton was so proud
of his Lily, that he offered her a chain as well, to go with
the watch. Lily refused at first, for form&#8217;s sake, and
then took courage&mdash;like a poor little martyr who did not
like to disoblige her Pa&mdash;and chose a very pretty watch-chain,
to the great wonderment of the Three Graces and
of Nunkie, who thought, as they left the shop, that the
children of to-day ... upon his word ... the
parents of to-day ... it was all very different in
his time....</p>
<p>Clifton laughed to himself at that old curmudgeon as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
he left him to go home, with his star. Lily hung heavily
on her father&#8217;s arm, passed the draper&#8217;s shops with a
serious air.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, another time!&#8221; said Pa, who felt what she was
after.</p>
<p>And he hurried his daughter off, for he might have
yielded, she was so nice.</p>
<p>Lily set her watch in Piccadilly, as they passed; then at
the Café de l&#8217;Europe, by the big clock at the back; and
again, twenty steps farther, at the bar of the Crown. Lily
looked at the time and Pa showed his Lily off. He was
proud to be seen with her in the neighborhood of Lisle
Street, where everybody knew him. True, he seemed to
have the name of being hard with Lily. But, come, was
he hard? Did she look like a martyr? It was preposterous,
all those stories. And he redoubled his attentions
to his daughter, who talked a heap of nonsense, asked
funny questions:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should writing a letter interfere with the trapeze,
when a girl has arms harder than a horse&#8217;s hocks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? What?&#8221; asked Pa, taken aback, and when
he understood, he would have held his sides for laughing,
if he had been at home:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the old rogue!&#8221; he said admiringly. &#8220;He loves
his dear girls, does Nunkie!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was still laughing when they reached Tottenham
Court Road; and, as they passed the Horse Shoe, a voice,
which Lily seemed to remember, called to them from
behind:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Clifton!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pa turned his head in surprise:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Trampy!&#8221;</p>
<p>For he recognized him at once, though he was much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
changed. Besides, he knew him to be in London. But it
was a prosperous and gorgeous Trampy, quite unlike the
old days; and forthwith Trampy explained: a champagne
supper last night, just come from the bar; glass of Vichy
water, you know. Huge success in London. Girls, by
Jove! And then, pretending not to know Lily:</p>
<p>&#8220;I congratulate you, Clifton; what a dear little wife!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pa, greatly amused, protested: not his wife, no, his
Lily! Then Trampy went into ecstasies: how pretty she
had grown, one of the handsomest girls in London, sure!
And in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland! And
in all the British dominions beyond the seas,
by Jove! And what a change since Mexico! She was a
woman now, a peach, a regular peach!</p>
<p>Lily seemed fascinated by Trampy, examined him, his
shiny hat, his gold rings, his patent-leather shoes. A
swell, Trampy, a toff, a gentleman like those in the front
boxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Lily,&#8221; said Trampy, guessing her thoughts,
&#8220;yes, that&#8217;s the way it is; one&#8217;s not always hard up.
I&#8217;ve struck oil since leaving America. Heaps of
money! Eh, what!&#8221; he continued, offering Clifton an expensive
cigar. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have thought it, would you,
when you left me stranded in Mexico? That was a nice
dirty trick you played me! Come and have a drain, old
man, to drink Miss Lily&#8217;s health and show there&#8217;s no ill
feeling!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, another time,&#8221; said Clifton, vexed at this recollection
of Mexico, now that he was the established owner of
a troupe, a man whose word was as good as gold. &#8220;I&#8217;m
in a hurry to get home: a very nice home, Trampy, a real
good one. Come and see us some day. <i>Au revoir</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Trampy was so pleased at meeting them, he never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
stopped shaking them by the hand. Lily had to accept a
bag of cakes to share with the troupe when they had their
tea. Then, at last:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Au revoir</i>, old man; <i>au revoir</i>, my love, my little
peach!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily&#8217;s head was quite turned by this jolly day: it made
her forget six months of worries. To think that, for
some people, every day was like that! However, she
mustn&#8217;t complain: a watch, a chain as well, the somersault
pulled off, compliments from Trampy....</p>
<p>Ma&#8217;s reception of them, when they got home, was icy.
Pa looked a little like a school-boy caught at fault; and
Lily, none too easy in her mind, put the cakes on the sideboard,
and hastened to take off her mother&#8217;s big hat. Ma
grumbled, under her breath: it was nothing but going
out, now. Old Cinderella could stay at home, bareheaded,
while my lady went shopping! A fine thing, my
word, for a great sensible girl to abuse her Pa&#8217;s weakness!
There was nothing to do at home, of course!
Well, if it pleased Mr. Clifton, she had no more to say!...
And, while she grumbled, Ma prepared the tea
and shot glances at Lily, a Lily with red cheeks and
bright eyes and looking so pretty that Ma, full of mixed
pride and anxiety, felt sudden longings to eat her up with
kisses, &#8220;ugly&#8221; that she was!</p>
<p>Pa did his best to calm Mrs. Clifton, tried to amuse her
with the story of the sleeve-links, of the horse&#8217;s hocks,
and Pa laughed, my!</p>
<p>&#8220;He laughs best who laughs last,&#8221; growled Ma.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think, Ma,&#8221; said Lily, taking courage from Pa&#8217;s
merriment. &#8220;That old rogue forbids his daughter to write,
he pretends that....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And quite right too!&#8221; said Ma. &#8220;What do girls want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
with writing? And who do you mean? What old rogue?
You don&#8217;t mean Mr. Fuchs, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Ma, old Fuchs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Fuchs! You chit, to talk like that of respectable
people! Go to your room, impudence! Dry bread for
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Ma...!&#8221; said Lily rebelliously.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what comes of it,&#8221; said Mrs. Clifton, addressing
her husband, &#8220;when a mother no longer has the right to
correct her daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she pointed to Lily, who persisted in remaining,
who was even beginning an explanation:</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Pa ... but....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Obey your mother first,&#8221; said Clifton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Pa.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily went out, very anxious at the turn which
things had taken.</p>
<p>Clifton realized that he had perhaps been wrong that
morning to blame Mrs. Clifton in Lily&#8217;s presence. He
was wrong also to laugh at old Fuchs before Lily. But,
all the same, that old rogue ... and they had believed
it, those Graces! That wouldn&#8217;t go down with
Lily!</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an example you ought to follow, instead of laughing
at it, Mr. Clifton!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon my word, I&#8217;m very proud of my Lily; she works
well, she really does,&#8221; said Pa, stretching himself in the
easy-chair. &#8220;I&#8217;m pleased with her; you know as well as I
do, a girl is not a boy. She can do with a little spoiling.
And only just now I made Lily a present of a gold watch
and chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I give up!&#8221; said Ma, in a voice of exasperation.
&#8220;Then I give up! Why should I take all this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
trouble bringing up your daughter? A little spendthrift
who will bring us all to the workhouse! And a good thing
when she does!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Pa wanted peace in his own house. That was
enough of it! Peace was what he wanted, damn it, and
not a monkey-and-parrot life!</p>
<p>And, jumping up from his chair, he opened the door
and shouted up the staircase:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down, my Lily! Your Ma says you may! The
cakes are on the table.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>Pa would have covered his Lily with diamonds, if he
had the money ... and if Ma had allowed it! But,
on this special point, she ventured to oppose him. She
had been Lily&#8217;s age herself, had Ma, and she enlarged
upon the necessity of keeping a tight rein on Lily.</p>
<p>Ma enumerated the fugitives: Ave Maria, and this
one, and that one, and ever so many others who had
bolted; and troupes ruined by the flight,&mdash;or the marriage,&mdash;of
the star....</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily has changed a good deal lately, dear, are you
sure she hasn&#8217;t a man in her mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There we are again!&#8221; said Pa. &#8220;Always the same old
story! But just tell me, who does she see? Who does
she know? Jimmy? You don&#8217;t mean him, I suppose?
Very well! Trampy, then? A married man, divorced,
married again, goodness knows what! and then ...
and then ... Oh, well, let&#8217;s have peace at home, at
any rate! Damn it, Lily may be a bit of a flirt: why
shouldn&#8217;t she be, a pretty girl like that? Beauty, in the
profession, is half the battle.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Pa entered into details, comforted Ma with good
news: a fresh contract signed with Bill and Boom, after
that, the Harrasford tour: big salaries now....</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear, this isn&#8217;t the time to worry Lily about
trifles. And I don&#8217;t want her to be bothered with useless
work, either.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Call home work useless! A woman&#8217;s greatest charm!&#8221;
exclaimed Ma.</p>
<p>Lily was a subject of friendly discussion to them. Both
adored her equally: both were proud of her at heart.
For Lily was growing very beautiful; everybody said so
at the theater: the stage-manager; the acting manager,
down to Jimmy, who stammered things. It was an endless
series of compliments; Harrasford&#8217;s friend, the
architect, who had not seen her for a long time, fell into
raptures when he met her on the stage:</p>
<p>&#8220;Magneeficent!&#8221; he exclaimed, in his Franco-Belgian
accent. &#8220;How old is she: sixteen? seventeen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fourteen,&#8221; said Ma, with a mincing air, for to that
damned &#8220;parley-voo&#8221; she was as anxious to make Lily
out a child now, in order to keep a firmer hold of her, as
she had been to increase her age in America, so as to
make her work.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, fourteen, Ma!&#8221; protested Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, fourteen, of course; do you think you know better
than your mother, you little fool? Can&#8217;t you see
everybody&#8217;s laughing at you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma dreaded those irresponsible jossers, who filled Lily&#8217;s
head with a pack of false notions, and kept a good watch,
in her growing anxiety.</p>
<p>Ma, in the early days of their arrival in London, had
been terribly obsessed by the dread of being left without
means in the huge city. Lily had got them out
of that difficulty. And now she was earning such a lot
of money: one day, who knows, they would have made
enough to assure their independence for good and all!
When she thought of this possibility, Ma&#8217;s eyes lit up
with yellow gleams; she felt like catching hold of Lily
and locking her up in a safe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>Pa was less eager for gain, less ant-like in his economies;
he was an artiste, above all; he knew how to make
allowances; there was a time for work and a time for
play. He often treated himself to the pleasure of taking
Lily out; and, each time, as usual, she got a nice little
present&mdash;he liked to pass for a Pa who spoiled his
daughter, loved to hear himself so described, and took a
wicked delight in repeating it all to Mrs. Clifton.</p>
<p>Lily was the gainer by the difference in opinion; she
felt herself a little freer. When she went out in the
morning, she considered herself at liberty to walk less
fast, and no longer trembled on returning. She loved
to loiter in the Tottenham Court Road; her little person
assumed an air of importance; if, after practice, some
artiste passed her in the street and gave her a smile, she
believed that he was waiting for her; a &#8220;comic quartet,&#8221;
the Out-of-Tune Musicals, happening to come out of a
bar and blow a kiss to her, were there on her account,
she thought&mdash;four lovers at a swoop!</p>
<p>It was almost impossible that she should not meet
Trampy, who was always prowling about from bar to
bar, between Oxford Street and Leicester Square. She
did meet him, in fact. Trampy, that day, wore a felt hat,
a blue suit, a red tie, with a sixpenny Murias cocked in the
corner of his mouth, and he greeted her with a triumphant
&#8220;Hullo, peach!&#8221; as she passed. Lily was quite excited,
stopped just long enough to refuse a drink and
then left him very quickly. She was afraid it showed
on her face, when she got home, and his words still rang
in her ears, that she was awfully pretty, the prettiest
girl on the stage, a peach, a duck, a pearl, a daisy, a bird.</p>
<p>All that she had seen and heard in her jostled existence,
now came back to her, grew and sprouted in her ...
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
now that Lily was being made love to by gentlemen, not
the monkey-faces or the blue-chins, but men like Trampy,
her craving for admiration oozed out of her at every
pore....</p>
<p>Trampy! Lily did not care for Trampy; but she
thought him amiable, polite with the girls.... She
was grateful to him for being there to say pretty things
to her when she passed. She preferred that type to
men like Jimmy, for instance, savages who always seemed
on the point of speaking and never opened their mouths;
with them, she thought, a wife would be bored to death.
Besides, Jimmy, pooh, a common workman, a josser!
While Trampy was an artiste, a bill-topper and rich, no
doubt. You had only to listen to Trampy to see that he
was very well off! Chocolates, sweets, jewelry, ostrich-feathers,
patent-leather boots, everything! He would
have loaded her with presents, if she had let him, but she
had never accepted anything except a little gold ring,
which she hid in her pocket when she came in, for, if Ma
had caught sight of it, gee, what a smacking!</p>
<p>Trampy often met her; he seemed almost to do so on
purpose; he found pretty speeches, compliments which
he had already uttered a score of times to ever so many
girls, on ever so many stages, like a real Don Juan who
had been all over the world and everywhere picked
up love-speeches and jokes to &#8220;fetch&#8221; the ladies with. He
tickled her vanity, told her that a dear little girl like her
was cut out for dress, that a big hat with ostrich feathers
would go well with her fair hair and that men, by Jove,
ought to go on their knees whenever they spoke to her!</p>
<p>All this hummed and buzzed in her head. At night,
when she fell asleep in Maud&#8217;s arms, she dreamed of big
hats and fine dresses and referred to it during the day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
Pa hardly knew what to think; if she did as well as last
night&mdash;three encores&mdash;Lily could have half a sovereign,
to buy a new hat in the Tottenham Court Road with, said
Pa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Pa, I shall do all right, you&#8217;ll see. Will you be
very nice? Then get me that one at two guineas, you
know, in Regent Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re mad, Lily!&#8221; said Pa, without attaching too
much importance to it, for he had other cares: agents to
see, letters to write, business, damn it!</p>
<p>That took down Lily&#8217;s cheek a bit; but her luxurious
ideas returned, nevertheless. For instance, from admiring
the Three Graces or the Gilson girl, who looked like
Venuses in their silk tights and whose entrance on the
stage caused every opera-glass to glint upon them,
the wish to appear in tights began to grow on Lily.
Oh, not the plain tights of living statues; no, but with
flowers and leaves embroidered here and there and jet
braid laced about the right arm. She was tired of
bloomers and told Pa so, straight out, when the apprentices
had left the room and Pa, stretched in his easy-chair,
seemed in a good temper. Pa thought this notion
about tights, silly:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re very nice, those bloomers; those little shirts.
Ask your mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Ma sarcastically, &#8220;but bloomers are
made at home, in the afternoon; you have to stitch them
yourself, dear. Tights, which you buy ready-made and
which cost just ten times as much and last only half as
long, are much more convenient, aren&#8217;t they, Lily? To
say nothing of the absurdity of an ugly girl like you showing
yourself in tights!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the troupe,&#8221; said Pa. &#8220;What would the troupe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
look like? Might as well not have a troupe; there&#8217;d be
no one but you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what harm would that do? I <i>am</i> the troupe!&#8221;
said Lily, tossing her obstinate forehead. &#8220;And all the
money you give them you could give me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily,&#8221; said Pa, alarmed, &#8220;you deserve to be smacked
for that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Pa, what an idea!&#8221; said Lily, who was just arranging
her fringe before the glass. &#8220;A Pa to beat his
Lily for a little thing like that, away from work!&#8221; And,
darting a bright smile at Pa, &#8220;You never would, Pa,
would you?&#8221; she ventured.</p>
<p>Clifton, taken aback, looked at his Lily, as if to say
that she was right, damn it! But Ma, in her fury, cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a bit! You shall see if <i>I</i> would!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bang! A box on the ears, followed by an order to
go to her room, on dry bread and water, impudence!
And practise her banjo till the evening!</p>
<p>The blow itself was nothing, but what an humiliation
for Lily, who, only yesterday, had been told that she
had the sweetest nose in the world, cheeks to cover with
kisses, eyes, lovely eyes: there wasn&#8217;t a girl in a hundred
with eyes like that, by Jove! And those lovely eyes
were only fit to cry with! And those pretty cheeks Ma
had covered with smacks! When she thought of it, she felt
inclined to kick over the traces. Did they think her such
a kid, then, her Pa and Ma? She&#8217;d show Ma if she was
fourteen! She&#8217;d be off like the others. Lily, at this idea,
felt her heart come into her mouth: no, no; she would
never dare; she never would. She swore it to herself;
took the great oath of the stage: three fingers of her right
hand uplifted, the left hand on her lucky charm. And yet,
one day, she would marry. She didn&#8217;t lack chances, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
she wanted them. And a gentleman, too! And her Pa
and Ma, to disgust her, of course, pretended that he was
married! They must take her for an idiot: how could
Trampy be married, considering that he had suggested
... suggested different things to her?...</p>
<p>Lily brooded like this, reviewing the tiny events of
which her life was made up. Then a gleam of sunshine
came to change her thoughts. She amused herself
by breathing on the window-pane, making a circle ...
wrote a name with her finger and quickly licked it out
with her tongue ... and Lily brooded ...
brooded....</p>
<p>But Ma&#8217;s voice made her jump:</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing there, you good-for-nothing?
I told you to take your banjo!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Ma,&#8221; Lily replied mechanically, with her nose
glued to the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you hear, Mr. Clifton?&#8221; said Ma furiously. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the way she obeys!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Clifton had no doubt whatever that there was a
man at the bottom of it ... a flirtation ...
something or other. It was useless for Ma to provide
for everything, to do her best to oppose Mr.
Clifton&#8217;s weakness. There was Lily now, taking up an
independent attitude. She thought herself pretty, no
doubt; some booby must have been stuffing her up,
making love to her, to laugh at her later on! If she,
Mrs. Clifton, had been a man, she would certainly never
look at that ill-mannered baggage; but the London jossers
liked that brazen type! And to think that time was
passing ... passing!... Oh, Ma would have
liked to get hold of the man who invented the law
about girls coming of age ... and love ... and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
marriage! A fierce jealousy seized upon her at the
thought. Lily would have bouquets, champagne suppers;
Lily would be loved by gentlemen! Tell Lily that she
was pretty and, in less than six months the little hussy
would think herself a fine lady! And, on that day, Mrs.
Clifton would wash her hands of her!</p>
<p>These continued attacks ended by shaking Pa. He
didn&#8217;t quite know what to say; there was a certain amount
of truth in it:</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he persisted, &#8220;why should she go? She has
everything she wants here?&#8221;</p>
<p>But he was more and more annoyed; yes, he admitted,
he was wrong to laugh at Mr. Fuchs: you must never set
children a bad example. And, from that moment, once
his attention had been called to the matter, he daily discovered
fresh causes for uneasiness: where the devil did
she get that love of dress from? And who sent her that
bouquet behind the scenes the other night? Why, Lily
wanted to have it handed to her across the footlights, like
a singer!</p>
<p>And Pa and Ma watched Lily like a bag of money on
which one keeps one&#8217;s hand, for fear of pickpockets. Ma
doubled her precautions.</p>
<p>The gentlemen in the front boxes, especially, alarmed
her, even more than the Jim Crows: creatures apart, devilish
creatures, the gentlemen in the front boxes! She
fancied she saw a reflection of hell in the eye-glass of
every one of them. If ever Lily dared to smile to them,
she knew what awaited her! Ma would get angry for
nothing at all; she even scolded Lily for allowing herself
to be approached on the stage by a contributor to <i>The
Piccadilly Magazine</i>, which was publishing articles on
<i>The Little Favorites of the Public</i>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you only told him a lot of nonsense,&#8221; said
Ma. &#8220;A girl should call her mother in a case like that.
What have you to do with the public? Aren&#8217;t you
ashamed?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, Lily was not ashamed. She was exasperated
rather. And she had not told the journalist any lies:
just the plain truth, in her own little way. Sweat and
blood! Broken legs! Broken arms! And here, there,
there, all over her body, scars deep enough to put
your finger in! That would revenge her a bit for the
way in which she was treated. She knew that, when the
article appeared, she would catch it at Pa&#8217;s hands; but
never mind! She had told everything, everything, in revenge;
just as she might have flung her bike at their
heads in a fit of anger!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>There had been a terrible scene at home that day. Ma
had searched Lily&#8217;s trunk and had not, it is true, discovered
the love letters which she believed to be hidden
there, but she had found a ring! It was Trampy&#8217;s ring,
which Lily, who usually concealed it about her person,
had left by accident in the trunk among her things. Ma&#8217;s
face was a sight, when she came down to the dining-room.
She was so upset that Pa asked her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ill, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma, without answering the question, pushed the ring
under his nose and screamed that she had told him so:</p>
<p>&#8220;An engagement ring, dear; an engagement ring!
Perhaps you&#8217;ll believe me now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pa and Ma, when they had recovered from their surprise,
had time to lay their heads together and replace the
ring, pretending to know nothing, to be watching more
closely than ever ... and then Pa had gone out;
for, if Lily, who was walking with the apprentices, had
come home just then, he could not have resisted the
temptation to smack her face. It was better to go out
and postpone the explanation until later. He had, indeed,
resolved never to beat his daughter again ...
but still! And he clenched his fists and ground his teeth
when he reached the theater.</p>
<p>On the stage, he looked round for Tom, who should
have been there to mend a tire. He saw nothing at first:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
only a few electric lamps studding the darkness; a faint
glimmer lighting up a number of properties; farther on,
the dull gleam of stacked-up bikes; and, lastly, Tom, with
his cap cocked back and trousers turned up, trying&mdash;brrr!&mdash;to
do a clog-dance!</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo, Tom!&#8221; shouted Clifton, the moment he saw
him. &#8220;Just you wait a bit. I&#8217;ll teach you to dance: with
the clogs on your hands and your head downwards, damn
it! Here, take this to go on with!&#8221; continued Pa, fetching
him a clout on the shoulder. &#8220;And get to the bikes
and hurry up, or I&#8217;ll smash your jaw in!&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jimmy had also come, unseen by Pa. And
the great batten lit up: the stage came to life again.
Right up above, in the galleries from which the ropes
were worked, mysterious forms moved to and fro. The
iron curtain rose ... there was a clash of orchestra
... Jimmy, with his back against the drop-scene
and his face to the stage, gave sharp orders....</p>
<p>Pa watched the scene vaguely from the wings. He
gnawed his mustache: the apprentices would be there
soon, with his Lily. And he had something to say to
the stage-manager; something of a delicate character.</p>
<p>But Clifton was surprised to see Jimmy instead of the
usual stage-manager:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo! So it&#8217;s you now,&#8221; he couldn&#8217;t help saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Mr. Clifton; since this morning. The other
chap&#8217;s ill, you know. Harrasford asked me to take his
place ... for a few days, I suppose ... or
perhaps longer. Do you want to speak to me, Mr. Clifton?&#8221;
added Jimmy, observing Pa&#8217;s look of embarrassment.
&#8220;Just a minute and I am yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two tall footmen, caparisoned in velvet and gold, disappeared
behind the curtain with the number of the next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
turn. They came back in a few seconds. Jimmy pressed
a button. The stage filled with light and noise, the turn
marked on the program entered and, suddenly, under the
dazzling light, it was a series of somersaults, of flights
from shoulder to shoulder, and the muffled fall of feet on
the thick carpet.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be eight minutes of this,&#8221; said Jimmy, taking
out his watch. &#8220;What have you to say to me, Mr.
Clifton?&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, what he had to say was very simple; he wouldn&#8217;t
have mentioned it himself, but Mrs. Clifton had asked
him to. To cut a long story short, wasn&#8217;t it a shame that
gentlemen should throw bouquets on the stage when Lily
was giving her show? Like last night, for instance: why,
it was making game of a child, putting ideas into her
head! Lily, of course, paid no attention to it. However,
was it or was it not allowed to throw or send bouquets
on the stage?</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you know it is!&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;How would you
have me prevent it?&#8221;</p>
<p>If he could have prevented it, he would. To begin
with, Jimmy realized the bothers which it brought down
upon Lily. Moreover, Jimmy, who was vaguely uneasy
himself, wondered who that ardent admirer could be.
Some of Roofer&#8217;s girls thought they had recognized
Trampy, from the stage, in the front seats. What Jimmy
had heard of Trampy did not inspire him with confidence.
And Trampy, it appeared, was making love to
Lily. Mr. Fuchs had met them at the corner of Oxford
Street and Newman Street. The story was quite definite.</p>
<p>Jimmy was astonished at the audacity of a Trampy:
what could he say to her? he asked himself, what could
he propose to her? Marriage? He was married, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
said, in America. To run away with him? His scandalous
life, his habit of easy conquest made this very likely.
Jimmy had seen plenty of others, big ones who topped
the bill and who did not despise a girl&#8217;s companionship&mdash;on
the contrary&mdash;and six months later, a year,
two years later, left the girl in a hole, stranded, undone;
mustard and game for Jim Crow. And he grew more
and more anxious on Lily&#8217;s behalf: not that Lily would
come to that! Yet he had seen plenty of them, since he
had frequented the stage, plenty of Lilies who had taken
to flight for injuries often less serious than hers. He
could have mentioned names: his head was full of those
who let their anger, or their folly, get the better of them
and escaped at random, and who went back to every-day
life&mdash;through the door of scandal&mdash;sometimes to meet
with worse: martyrdom of the heart, base exploitation in
the name of love. Oh, he pitied them from the bottom
of his soul! No, Lily shouldn&#8217;t run away: it was impossible!
But what a pity, all the same, that he could think
of it! And what chance, what meeting would settle her
fate and make her&mdash;who could say?&mdash;the companion of a
loving heart, or a prey to some footy rotter? Oh, how he
would have liked to go for Trampy, to break his jaw for
him, to teach him to mind his business and leave Lily
alone! And what Jimmy wanted to do he was never far
from doing! And, then, oh, if he could procure a good
position for Clifton, as an equivalent for his star and
make Lily love him, marry him: that would be better
still!</p>
<p>This idea, perhaps, without his knowing it, dominated
his present life, doubled his power of work: to invent
something! To get himself talked about! To make
money, plenty of money, become somebody! Others before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
him had risen from nothing. Harrasford, to go
no farther ... a chap who had climbed every rung
of the ladder: a small music-hall first; then two; then a
big one; then two; then ten. And a whole army now
toiling and moiling for him every night, for him the chief
and master.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; thought Jimmy. &#8220;If I could only climb the ladder
too!&#8221;</p>
<p>First of all, he must choose his line, for his efforts to
tell. And, since chance had given him a start at the theater,
why not go on? Here his scientific luggage would
be of use to him. It was only a question of adding
pluck to it. He was the man to do so and now more
than ever. Things which used to seem impossible to
him, such as his invention published in <i>Engineering</i>, appeared
quite feasible, now that he had watched Lily
do her wonderful feats of balancing on the stage. It was
only a question of courage and hard practice. Another
line suggested itself: to find capital and start a theater.
As regards the stage itself, by this time he understood
the management of it from grid to cellar. He seemed
to take in at a glance that huge entirety, from the
flies with their windlasses, their bridges, the labyrinth
of stairs, the maze of passages, down to the dressing-rooms
and the painted faces that filled them: here, a
Lily; there, a buck nigger; farther on, a living-picture
girl. He felt all this rustle round him, carried it all in
his head: he knew it all, from the porter&#8217;s box at the
stage-door to the glittering front of the house, with its
palm-trees and its liveried chuckers-out. Jimmy knew
what to think of the enchantments of the stage, those
luminous visions which the audience admired to the tune
of the orchestra: jealousies, vanities, hatreds to knock up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
against and calm down; recruits to put through their
paces; and the whole day of it&mdash;and the whole night,
too&mdash;for a few pounds a week, including the tips received
from the artistes, twenty-five to forty shillings a month.</p>
<p>But Jimmy had his idea: he was determined to obtain
a thorough grasp of the business; he had already taken
possession of the stage-manager&#8217;s room and of his desk
with the many compartments: photographs, programs,
contracts, electric light, staff, scenery. A whole small
people depended upon him, and asked his advice, bragged
of its successes or told him of its misfortunes. And here
again was Clifton continuing his jeremiads: they would
drive his daughter silly by making game of her, pretending
to be in love with her, at her age! Jimmy listened
attentively, with one eye on the stage and the other on his
watch:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut!&#8221; he said, trying to arrange things. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
great harm in receiving bouquets on the stage. However,
as you object, if any more of them come, they shall be
handed to you, to dispose of as you please. That&#8217;s all that
I can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was gradually filling up behind Clifton and Jimmy;
the iron door was constantly slamming upon the passage;
knowing-looking Roofer girls passed, two by two, always
two by two, joked for a moment with the scene shifters,
shook hands here and there, disappeared up the dressing-room
staircase. There was life, swarming life, everywhere,
in the corners, behind the back-cloth. The New
Zealanders arrived, with Lily and her Ma, for Ma never
left her now, for fear of the gentlemen who prowled
around like famished hyenas: villains who did not hesitate
to throw bouquets on the stage to make ugly girls
think they were pretty!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>Lily seemed sad. She stopped for a moment. A
haunting serenade droned across the stage, a Spanish
melody sung by soft tremolo voices, with tapping of
tambourines. It reminded her of Mexico: everything
reminded her of that time now. She compared herself
with Ave Maria. Oh, she would have liked to tell the
whole world how she was treated, just the plain truth!&mdash;in
her own little way. But no one cared, not even that
rotten josser of a journalist, with his article published
in <i>The Piccadilly Magazine</i>. It made her out a spoiled
child, who had learned to ride in the country-lanes, with
her French governess, and who had surprised her father
and mother by coming home one day with her head on
the saddle of her bicycle and her feet in the air, thereby
causing an unparalleled scandal in that old Yorkshire
family. Since then, they had been obliged to yield
to her fancies and allow her to go on the stage with
her little troupe of friends. Her salary? Ten pounds
a night. Her recreation? The banjo....</p>
<p>&#8220;Rotten josser of a journalist!&#8221; thought Lily.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she was flattered at heart because of the
ten pounds a night and the governess.</p>
<p>But things happened to distract her thoughts: the
Three Graces entered in their turn, followed by Nunkie;
they stood talking for a few moments, while the apprentices
went and dressed; and Lily soon followed them,
after a last glance at a little woman and her &#8220;partner,&#8221;
who were getting things ready for their performance&mdash;-some
little hoops, two cardboard bottles, gilt balls&mdash;and
then waited humbly in the shadow.</p>
<p>Lily recognized Para, who used to exhibit a troupe of
parrots; somebody had put her &#8220;in his show,&#8221; no doubt,
the Para-Paras, a new turn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How poor she looks!&#8221; Lily could not help whispering
to Ma.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be worse off yourself, some day,&#8221; said Ma, &#8220;if
you go on as you&#8217;re doing! Don&#8217;t laugh at other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily had dressed quickly and had come down to the
stage with the Three Graces and they had ten minutes of
joking behind the scenes, while Ma was still up-stairs,
busy with the girls. Thea walked on tip-toe to restore
the circulation to her legs; Kala practised back-bendings:
Lily applauded with the tip of her thumbnail, flung back
her head and laughed and, from time to time, looked
round over her shoulder to see if Ma was coming down.</p>
<p>She amused herself also by feeling Thea&#8217;s arms, all
those little muscles which stood out, man&#8217;s arms: she
would have liked to nestle in them, to feel herself squeezed
till she cried out. And everything around them savored
of love: there were lots of Roofers; little intrigues were
embarked upon; there were stifled fits of laughter and
cries of &#8220;Hands off!&#8221; and &#8220;Stop!&#8221; Amorous speeches and
stories of romantic adventures were exchanged in whispers;
the flight of the Gilson girl, the other day, at Liverpool,
was told in full detail; a Roofer, it seemed, giving
a high kick the day before, had sent her slipper flying
into the audience; it was returned to her filled with chocolate
creams; and to-day there was a boquet with a letter
in it.</p>
<p>Ting! The curtain, the light; and, on the stage, the
Roofers were glittering with gold and silver and their
boyish voices came in gusts, punctuated by the jerky
flights of their short skirts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your old sweetheart, eh, Lily?&#8221; said Thea, pointing to
the boy-violinist, who had just arrived.</p>
<p>Lily had only a careless glance for the boy-violinist,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
who was wiping his eye-glasses and pulling at his cuffs,
while a call-boy was adjusting the false seat into which
two bulldogs would presently dig their teeth. All the
fascination was gone for Lily: it was no longer the child
prodigy; a grotesque Orpheus, in a laurel and parsley
crown, he now introduced his music-hating dogs, who interrupted
his performance with plaintive and angry howls
and ended by leaping at the seat of his trousers in a mad
rush across the stage.</p>
<p>Lily, who had &#8220;gone through the mill,&#8221; looked upon
him as a mere josser, had for him the instinctive contempt
entertained by the real artiste for those fiddlers,
those singers, those dancers and other drones brought
up with blows of the hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! I have some one better than that,&#8221; exclaimed
Lily, excited by the proximity of the Roofers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have any one better than that and he loves
you,&#8221; said Thea, in a dreamy voice, &#8220;love him, Lily, keep
him; as for me, I no longer risk having to do with men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do!&#8221; Lily whispered, with a frightened glance
around her. &#8220;As much as I can! I love talking to men!
Why, Thea, and don&#8217;t you like love letters and p.-c.&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ting! Ting! Orpheus left the stage, with his bulldogs
hanging to him.</p>
<p>Ting! It was dark again; ropes, plated rings were let
down from the flies; the Three Graces, like quivering
marble statues, took one another by the hand to make
their entrance.</p>
<p>Ting! From their perches on either side, two electricians
sent the lime-light beating down on an involved
group of ropes, bars and hardened limbs.</p>
<p>Ting! A crescendo in the orchestra and, bowing to the
audience across the footlights, the Three Graces made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
their exit, their smiles suddenly hollowed out into tired
wrinkles, but cheerful nevertheless. And Nunkie wiped
their foreheads with his checked handkerchief, helped
them on with their big cloaks; and the three goddesses
were now just a wrapped-up group, limping off to the
staircase, like gouty patients at a spa.</p>
<p>Ting! A forest scene is let down, the wings are shifted.
A click of chains, a flash of steel. The bikes in the shadow,
the apprentices mounted, Lily leading.</p>
<p>&#8220;And try to do your best, my Lily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Pa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And try to behave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Ma.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ting!</p>
<p>Lily gave a nervous smile. She always felt a little
thrill before going on. Then, quick, in Indian file, two
and two, three and three, the New Zealanders whirled
round in the light, to the roar of a triumphal air.</p>
<p>Pa ground his teeth and clenched his fists the moment
he heard his music: at the mere sight of his Lily, his
seven stone of flesh and bones adapted to the machine,
unerring and exact, an immense intoxication exalted his
pride, gladness dilated his heart. At last! He was there
now: German discipline! English gracefulness! Everything!
He, too, would have his London home, with a
lawn behind the house and a plot of rose-trees. He would
learn the meaning of family joys, as Nunkie understood
them, with texts along the staircase: &#8220;Welcome!&#8221; and
&#8220;God bless our home!&#8221; And, more and more excited, he
built up his dream; his imagination gave itself scope amid
the unreal scenery, the forest depths, the green and gold
sky and his Lily, his faultless Lily, haloed in light!
Every hope was permissible when he looked at his Lily,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
his joy, his handiwork! His New Zealander on Wheels!
That india-rubber suppleness, those little nerves of iron,
his Lily, his glory, his star, his own star! He romanced
about her, dreamed of an imperial tour, a steamer
of his own, a floating
Barnum&#8217;s show, with
Roofers, elephants, rhinoceroses,
Ave Marias,
dogs, monkeys, the whole
boiling; and Lily starring
on her bike, stopping in
every port, from Liverpool
to Suez, from Suez
to Yokohama: down to
the desert, damn it, to
show the whole world
what an artiste he, Clifton,
he, the father, had
made of his Lily! And
he looked at her with loving
eyes, applauded her
with a smile, restored her
self-possession with a
twitch of the eyebrow
and counted her twirls on the back-wheel&mdash;O pride unspeakable!&mdash;a
dozen!</p>

<p class='captionc' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 177px;'>
SHE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF LILY<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Ma, standing by him, interested herself less in the show
and, neglecting the artiste, watched the daughter and
the faces she made at the gentlemen: the brazen flapper,
whose sole attraction lay in the wickedness in her blood!
She never lost sight of Lily and watched her closely, for
Ma seemed always to catch her throwing an appealing
glance to the seducers in the front boxes, to some St.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
George in full dress who would dart across the footlights
to carry off her daughter.</p>
<p>Thus caught between Pa and Ma, Lily&#8217;s situation was
hard indeed. As for the audience, she never troubled
about it, from custom, like a true professional, who
gives her performance mechanically, without minding
about the rest. The audience, to Lily, was, behind a
streak of flame, in the semi-darkness, a confused mass
of black and gray. All this had no existence for Lily or
the apprentices. The audience didn&#8217;t pay them! The
audience wouldn&#8217;t give her a whacking if the show went
badly! Pa, in the wings, frightened her much more than
all the audiences in the world; and Ma was worse still,
when a gentleman smiled at her from a box. Then Lily
would stare at her Ma with the terrified eye of a parrot
contemplating Para&#8217;s whip. She even exaggerated,
pinched her lips, like a school-girl applying herself to
her book for fear of the ferule. Ma did not ask so much
as that. Sometimes, when Lily, after a successful trick,
threw out her chest to draw breath more easily and rode
round the stage with a pretty smile on her lips, Ma saw
no harm in it, even rejoiced within herself at her daughter&#8217;s
beauty. Ma knew how to be just and not to be angry
for nothing. But what she could not forgive, what exasperated
her was, just that very evening, with her own
eyes, to see Lily smile at some person unknown and shoot
fiery glances at the front boxes, the little devil, who
would bring them to the grave with shame!</p>
<p>For Lily, it must be confessed, flung prudence to the
winds that night. Her head was turned with all those
love stories. They sang in her ears, they distended her
nostrils. Oppressed on every side, she escaped in imagination
toward that spacious house, toward the confused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
mass in which her lover sat hidden. And, in spite of Pa
and in spite of Ma, who stood watching her in the wings,
Lily searched the audience with her eyes. Was it really
Trampy? Had he come back? She had not met him for
some time. She wanted to know and he would surely
reveal himself. Ma might say what she pleased. Even
in the final pyramid, she looked, while, with one apprentice
on her shoulders, another forked before her, another
standing behind, two others on either side, she twice
went round the stage, with flags waving, to the hurricane
of the orchestra. And then ting! And darkness anew, the
stage suddenly invaded by scene-shifters dragging heavy
sets along; and Lily, passing out, was seized by her Ma,
who said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who were you laughing at?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t laughing, Ma!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you to make eyes at gentlemen, you baggage
you! I saw you this time! I saw you!&#8221; grumbled
Ma, who had the engagement ring still upon her mind.
&#8220;You shall pay for this, Lily; we&#8217;ll see if I can drive the
devil out of you or not!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Ma squeezed Lily&#8217;s arm as if she meant to break
it, but all this noiselessly, in the shadow, behind the scenery,
for fear of the stage manager. Besides, it was nobody&#8217;s
business what a mother thought fit to say
to her daughter, and Lily, when people passed, pluckily
tried to smile, so as to put them off, not to let them know
that she was being beaten, a big girl like her; but, as
soon as they were gone, she resumed her rebellious face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t laughing, I wasn&#8217;t laughing, Ma!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s to teach you to lie!&#8221; said Ma, catching her a
blow in the back of the neck.</p>
<p>The door of the staircase had swung to behind them;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
and, in the empty passage, the thumps continued all the
way to the dressing-room, which the apprentices had not
yet reached. Then, once inside, Ma pushed the bolt and
made a rush at Lily. And Lily raised her elbow in vain:
accompanied by a furious series of grunts&mdash;&#8220;Ugh! Ugh!
Ugh!&#8221;&mdash;Ma&#8217;s diligent fist &#8220;signed a contract on her
back&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t you dare to cry out, or I&#8217;ll give it you
twice as hard!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily, bruised all over, felt inclined to scratch her
mother, like a wildcat; but the apprentices were coming.
So she cooled her head in a basin of cold water and
dressed with all speed, assisted by Ma, who perhaps regretted
having been so hasty; but you had to be, with
devils like that! And Ma&#8217;s anger returned when, on
reaching the stage again, she was herself, in accordance
with Jimmy&#8217;s orders, handed a bouquet intended for
Miss Lily. What, another! Lily, following her down the
stairs with the New Zealanders, saw Ma take the bouquet
and toss it through the open door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; said Ma. &#8220;Give me your arm, Lily.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the New Zealanders walked away from the
brightly lit-up music-hall, plunged through the drifting
crowd, crossed the eddy of cabs, motors, &#8217;buses and, on
the pavements, through the windows, had visions of elegant
couples at sumptuous tables. Then they all went
through the dark streets; and Lily, escorted by Pa and
Ma, followed the herd of girls. Her face was hard and,
from an angry brow, she shot glances askance at flight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>Now Trampy&mdash;even if he had to marry her for it, by
Jove!&mdash;had set his mind on having Lily, at any cost; and
that not only because of her prettiness, but also that he
might play Clifton a damned good trick and teach him
that he must smart for treating a gentleman as he had
treated him in Mexico. It would be paying him out with
interest to take his Lily from him. Besides, think of the
credit it would give Trampy in the profession to have for
his wife the prettiest, the cleverest girl on the boards, each
of whose shows, when she performed alone, would be
worth at least three pounds, as much as a whole troupe!
He suspected in her the ripe fruit that was bound to drop;
and he shook the tree to hasten the fall. He considered
his reputation at stake: he, the man with the thirty-six
girls, as he was called at the music-hall. He got caught
in his own toils and wanted Lily madly, out of revenge
and pride ... and jealousy too, for he suspected
that Jimmy was courting her; and the idea that he had
a rival inflamed his ardor.</p>
<p>In the evening, pen in hand, in his dressing-room, or
else at a table in a café, after a second and a third glass
of old port, he prepared his batteries: letters, post-cards,
he excelled in everything, was careful about his phrases,
with the vanity of an author whose writings are widely
quoted. Lily was &#8220;fascinating&#8221; and &#8220;bewildering;&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
compared her to &#8220;those strange Indian poppies whose
scent intoxicates a man and sometimes gives him death.&#8221;
Gee, but that set Lily dreaming! Fancy having all that
in her! Who on earth would have thought it? Never
mind, it was very nice.</p>
<p>And the way in which she received her correspondence
amused her as much as the rest. Trampy, it goes without
saying, did not write direct: a few pence to Tom, who
hated Clifton, and Lily received the cards in secret, devoured
them when she was alone and then quickly tore
them into little pieces and sent them flying through the
window.</p>
<p>Her trouble was how to answer. She really did not
know what to say:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Pa was so angry with the girls yesterday. I got a
kick of the pedal on my shin. Otherwise I am quite
well. Excuse more for the present. I must now conclude.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lily</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>By return of post, she received &#8220;a thousand kisses on
her rosy cheeks, on her fair tresses, everywhere,&#8221; kisses
without end.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s mad,&#8221; thought Lily.</p>
<p>But she was greatly flattered by Trampy&#8217;s attentions.
He treated her as a woman, not as a child, as Pa and Ma
went out of their way to do. Her life, after all, would
be more agreeable if she was Trampy&#8217;s wife; and he
was delivering the attack in person, since his return from
Lancashire, where he had traveled about with his property
red-hot stove. He overwhelmed her with bouquets,
even as a general bombards a bastion before the final assault,
and he managed to meet her now. He dazzled Lily
with his big gold watch-chain and the diamond in his tie.
When he was able to whisper a word to her, it was always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the same thing&mdash;&#8220;Motor-cars! Paris gowns! Jewels!
Flowers!&#8221;&mdash;until Lily thought she saw all the shop-windows
in Regent Street poured out at her feet.</p>
<p>Jimmy made but a sorry lover, compared with Trampy.
He never promised anything, silk dresses, diamonds or
jewels. &#8220;The husband at work, the wife at home.&#8221; Gee,
there were no ostrich-feathers in that! But he adored
her all the same, as Lily was well able to see; and she had
many occasions to talk to both of them. Not that Lily
was less closely watched. She never went out alone, but it
was not always Ma who was at her heels: it was sometimes
Glass-Eye. With faithful Glass-Eye, things took
their own course and the interviews with Trampy became
easy. As for Jimmy, he saw her every day at practice
and he took that opportunity to tell her of his ideas, his
plans for the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall succeed, you will see, Lily,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I shall
do something some day. I&#8217;m a bit of a mechanic, a bit
of an electrician, that is to say, a bit of a wizard. Others
have started lower down and climbed very high.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Lily, &#8220;I know. It&#8217;s like Pa. He wasn&#8217;t
much before he got me into shape; and look at him now!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was said with an artless candor that enraptured
Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a dear little girlie you are!&#8221; he said. &#8220;What
an adorable kid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; retorted Lily. &#8220;Why not a baby, while
you&#8217;re about it, a school-girl in the biking-class and so
on? Some people treat me as a woman, Jimmy, and propose
to marry me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I say, Jimmy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And this man making up to you is worthy of you, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
suppose? And do you love him?&#8221; asked Jimmy, greatly
upset.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you wouldn&#8217;t marry him unless you loved him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should marry him to change my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A change, Lily,&#8221; said Jimmy, with feeling, &#8220;is not
always a change for the better! And your life is a little
pleasanter now, you told me so yourself. Your mother
is sorry. You&#8217;re getting pocket-money; ten shillings a
week, eh? Why, Lily, that&#8217;s splendid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well; and I earn it, I suppose,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;And Ma
isn&#8217;t a bit sorry. Pa said he wouldn&#8217;t have it, that&#8217;s all.
They were afraid of my running away if it went on. I
am no longer a child!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jimmy, taking her hands, &#8220;an adorable girl;
that&#8217;s what you are. Oh, a man whom you would love
should do great things! He would love you with all his
heart! And your life would be different then! No, you
would not be a performing dog, as you call it; you would
be a darling little wife. It&#8217;s all very well to rove about
the world, from theater to theater, riding round and
round on your bike....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I adore the stage, for all that!&#8221; interrupted Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that can&#8217;t go on for ever,&#8221; continued Jimmy.
&#8220;You&#8217;re entitled to have a nicer life: a home of your own,
Lily; you have the making of a lady in you, if you were
taught. In a year or two, Lily, you would be the equal of
any lady in the land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Learning, more learning, always learning! I&#8217;ve had
enough of it in my life!&#8221; muttered Lily, affected, nevertheless,
by Jimmy&#8217;s intense excitement, and lowering her
eyes under his glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Lily, always learning, that&#8217;s life!&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
Jimmy. &#8220;But the other chap, of course, promises you
the earth! Some millionaire, I suppose: an admirer in
the front boxes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an artiste,&#8221; said Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Jimmy, stepping back, without letting go
of her. &#8220;But, no, it&#8217;s impossible; you&#8217;re not thinking of
Trampy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said Lily angrily, trying to release herself
from Jimmy&#8217;s passionate grasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, because ... because he&#8217;s a drunkard
... a ... The other day I saw him at the bar
of the Crown, as I was passing. He was blind-drunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the good of talking?&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;He&#8217;s miserable.
He worships me. He drinks to forget. He told
me so himself!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they say he&#8217;s married,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;Why ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mean and jealous of you to say that,&#8221; said Lily,
suddenly withdrawing her hands. &#8220;You deserve a smacking!
How can he be married, when he wants to marry
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>And with that she left him and went up to the dressing-room.</p>
<p>Jimmy was heartbroken.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a joke of Lily&#8217;s ... as in my shop, some
months ago, when she pretended to have a sweetheart,
though she hadn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>But, argue as he would, Jimmy thought with terror of
Trampy&#8217;s habits of conquest, of his reputation in the profession
as a Don Juan. He bitterly regretted waiting so
long to speak to Lily. He had thought that he was pleasing
her by keeping in the background, for fear of causing
her annoyance at home: was his sole offense now that of
coming too late?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>Oh, if he had only had evidence to hand! But
Trampy&#8217;s marriage was one of those vague rumors. One
could say nothing for certain. However, the danger, no
doubt, was not yet imminent. And Jimmy had a friend
who was doing America in the theaters of the Eastern
and Western Trust: he resolved to write to him; the
friend would receive his letter at the Majestic, Houston,
Texas, or at the Denver Orpheum. The thing had
happened over there; they would probably remember it
in the theaters he passed through; he could make inquiries,
perhaps even obtain proofs. That exquisite Lily,
that masterpiece of grace: what a darling wife she would
make! And all for Trampy! Jimmy was determined to
do everything to prevent it.</p>
<p>He did not despair of supplying Lily, before long, with
the proof that Trampy was married; he would give the
name, the date; he would compel Trampy to admit it.
But he was not sure enough yet to accuse him openly:
Lily would have seen nothing in it but a ridiculous jealousy
and would never have forgiven him.</p>
<p>Then Jimmy was worried: people came to him for this,
for that, for the thousand details of the stage.</p>
<p>Lily, on her side, left the theater. That day, she was
accompanied by Maud, who fixed her with her glass eye,
while the other was engaged in watching the flies. Of
course, Trampy was prowling round the theater to see her
part of the way home; for he, too, had decided to carry
things with a high hand. And he set to work at a quicker
pace than ever.</p>
<p>He had none of Jimmy&#8217;s scruples; he was not afraid of
exaggerating: far from it. Lily always left him under
the impression of a glimpse of paradise. This time, however,
she failed to smile when Trampy vowed that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
was &#8220;the sweetest little thing that one could lay eyes on,
by Jove!&#8221; For a long time, but especially since that
morning, she had been burning to put a question to him.
Possibly she had no intention of marrying him, but she
wouldn&#8217;t allow him to make a fool of her; and she interrupted
him in his compliments to ask if what they said
was true.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says so? It&#8217;s a lie!&#8221; Trampy hastened to answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean your marriage,&#8221; replied Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought as much,&#8221; said Trampy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me the truth,&#8221; persisted Lily innocently, looking
him straight in the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I was married, Lily, would I want to marry you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said Lily, already shaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s been talking to you about that?&#8221; asked Trampy.
&#8220;Your Pa, eh? And Jimmy: I&#8217;ll bet that Jimmy ...?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t box that fellow&#8217;s ears!&#8221; shouted Trampy.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see that he&#8217;s jealous? Why? He didn&#8217;t even
give you my bouquets! He handed them to your Ma!
And so I&#8217;ve been married, eh? Whereabouts? In America,
I&#8217;ll wager?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, somewhere on the Western Tour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Trampy. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve heard
myself. Still, it seems to me that, if I had a wife, I
ought to be the first to know it; don&#8217;t you think so, Lily?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was proof positive. Lily could find nothing to
answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and have a drink, Lily?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re waiting for me at home,&#8221; said Lily.</p>
<p>Trampy went into the bar alone, in a desperate state of
love which made him call for a port and another, by
Jove! Then he sat down at a table in a corner, lit a cigar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
and examined his glass, as though truth lay at the bottom.
For he could not tell for certain. Was he married or was
he not? That&#8217;s what he himself would like to know!
According to him, upon his soul and conscience, he was
not a married man; he did himself that justice. Opportunities,
certainly, had not been wanting ... with
all the girls he had known ... enough to fill a
dozen beauty-shows. Sometimes even he had had a narrow
escape, as in that damned town in the West, in one
of those states where you can&#8217;t so much as take a girl to
supper without finding yourself married to her in the
morning, all for entering yourself in the hotel book as
&#8220;Mr. and Mrs. Trampy,&#8221; in other words, as man and
wife. And yet he couldn&#8217;t ask the girl who adored him
to sleep on the mat! Yes, a poor girl who had found
glowing words in which to tell him her love, one night
in Mexico, words which had set Trampy quivering with
longing compassion: was he to be reproached with that?
He had made her happy, after all; and, on the whole,
this lark was one of his pleasantest memories; it hadn&#8217;t
lasted too long: a matter of a few weeks at most. He
had left Mexico, taking the girl with him, and played
Trampy Wheel-Pad in the Western States, with any
amount of success, by Jove! Encores, packets of tobacco,
a new suit of clothes! And, by way of <i>entr&#8217;acte</i>, the girl&mdash;&#8220;Tramp
Wheel-Pad&#8217;s Jumping Flea,&#8221; as she was called&mdash;turned
somersaults and flip-flaps. But she would have
killed him, this dark girl with great dark eyes,&mdash;this
girl with a boy&#8217;s figure, all muscle and sinew, keeping
him awake all night and talking of nothing but smackings,
as though she had never learned anything else.
And so much in love that she would bite and scratch:
a very tigress. Any one but himself would have wearied
of it. And then, one fine morning, for coupling their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
names in the visitors&#8217; book, they found themselves married,
in the name of the law! And that was what people
called a marriage! So little married were they, according
to him, that he had given her the slip then and
there, leaving her all the money he possessed, however:
he was not the man to look at fifteen dollars, when honor
demanded it. Trampy had had more stories of this kind
in his life; they left as much impression on his mind as
the recollection of a &#8220;schooner&#8221; swallowed at a bar on a
summer night.</p>
<p>It was dishonest, he considered, to pretend that he was
married. Not that he was perfect: far from it! He did
not set up as a model. He had had scandals in his life:
he admitted it humbly; and, if some jealous person,
some Jimmy, for instance, wanted to do him harm, all he
had to do was to dig in the heap, instead of hawking
round that story of an imaginary marriage.</p>
<p>His differences with Poland, the Parisienne, for instance:
a regular Mrs. Potiphar, that one. He had found
it a hard job to get away from her. And ever and ever
so many others! He couldn&#8217;t remember. People were always
talking ill of him. There was more than that, however:
he, too, was capable of manly ambition; he, too, had
taken a breakneck risk. He had perfected and patented
at Washington an invention of which he had seen a
drawing, by accident, in a scientific journal&mdash;<i>Engineering</i>,
or another&mdash;a purely theoretical invention. The inventor
himself, a young London electrician, declared it
to be unrealizable. Well, he, Trampy&mdash;Poland had
helped him with her purse; she was very nice about it&mdash;he,
Trampy, had had the thing made. He had deposited
the models at the Patent Office; and the apparatus itself
was now in a London storage. He would get it out, some
day, and show them all what he was capable of.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>Now he was wrong, perhaps, in abandoning Poland,
after accepting her services; but, after all, those were
matters which concerned nobody but himself. It was not
fair play to tell Lily about them: she, he felt, would always
be the girl of his heart, the thirty-seventh and last,
and it would take a better man than Jimmy to snatch her
from him!</p>
<p>Already, it was much to have pacified Lily on that incident
of the marriage: Lily believed him. One thing,
however, disquieted Trampy: bigamy, all the same, meant
doing time. Now, if some jealous person produced the
proof of that marriage, contracted under the Western
law ... suppose it were valid ... really valid?
H&#8217;m! Was he going to lose Lily for that? And his liberty
into the bargain? That Lily who was worth her weight in
gold, love and fortune in one!</p>
<p>Trampy resolved to broach this delicate subject:</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I was married,&#8221; he hinted, one day, &#8220;that
wouldn&#8217;t matter. Couldn&#8217;t we ... live together ...
eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like your style!&#8221; said Lily, feeling slightly indignant
at such a proposal. &#8220;What do you take me for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was only joking,&#8221; Trampy hastened to say. &#8220;If
you want to be married, I&#8217;m quite agreeable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I insist upon it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So then you prefer to take strangers into our confidence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What strangers?&#8221; asked Lily, in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the quill-drivers at Somerset House and those
damned fire-escapes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily had enough religion to know that the fire-escape
was the clergyman:</p>
<p>&#8220;As for that,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we shall see later; but I want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
the registrar&#8217;s office. If I&#8217;m to be your little wife, I want
to be so for good and all: marriage or nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted, Lily!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m determined!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily was the more bent upon it, because marriage made
her free: that was the essential point. If she were not
married, her parents could make her come back, she
thought ... keep her with them ... gee! It gave
her cold shivers down the back! Once married, she was
protected by law; Pa and Ma had nothing to say; and so
she was very keen upon marriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a dear little wife she&#8217;ll make!&#8221; thought Trampy.
&#8220;And how she loves me!&#8221;</p>
<p>That, however, did not advance matters. It was all
very well for him to put his arm round her waist, to talk
softly to her, to whisper those words which had already
won him so many conquests:&mdash;one day, even, he had kissed
her on the lips,&mdash;Lily thought that very nice; it was all
very well for him to cut a dash at the bar, to stand her a
claret and a biscuit; it was all very well for him to sing
his love-litany: all this did not help him; at the rate at
which he was going, he wouldn&#8217;t get anywhere in six
months.</p>
<p>Lily, between those two jossers, amused herself immensely.
How lucky she was! Two men, at her age!
They irritated her, sometimes; when they went too far&mdash;Trampy,
especially, who got excited at the game&mdash;anyhow,
it was a homage paid to her beauty. Between
that and going away with him there was all the difference
in the world! To leave home was quite another
matter. Why, goodness, if things went on as they were,
she could do without marriage at all!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Lily, come down!&#8221; Pa&#8217;s voice thundered from below.</p>
<p>Lily was out of bed in a bound. She could hardly tie
her skirt-strings for trembling. Why was Pa in such a
rage?</p>
<p>The moment Lily entered her parents&#8217; room, she realized
what it was. Pa was holding a letter in his hand and
scowling at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are nice stories I hear!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You let men
kiss you? You&#8217;ve got a love affair? Come, Lily, is this
true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Jimmy&#8217;s doing,&#8221; thought Lily. &#8220;The mean cur!
He&#8217;s given me away!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pa went on hotly:</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re going to marry, are you? To marry
Trampy? Here, read that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily felt hopeless. She took the letter, but did not attempt
to read it. White with fear, could she have sprung
through the window and fled, she would have done so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Pa went on apace, growing more and more excited,
&#8220;is all this true? All that they tell me: about your
receiving letters, post-cards, jewelry ... and that
ring! I&#8217;ve seen it! You&#8217;re going to marry Trampy, are
you? Oh, the man who writes to me knows all about it,
saw you with him at the corner of Oxford Street and
Newman Street. Is that true, miss? What did you have
to tell him, pray? Speak out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily, terror-stricken, could only droop her head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true then that you want to get married, you baggage!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pa!&#8221; cried Lily.</p>
<p>But he, with an &#8220;Ah!&#8221; of rage, sprang upon her,
clutched her mass of hair, banged her head against the
wall:</p>
<p>&#8220;On your knees! Say, &#8216;I&mdash;beg&mdash;your&mdash;par&mdash;don&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>And, Bang! Bang! Bang! The phrase was punctuated
with thumps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Clifton,&#8221; implored Ma, &#8220;stop! Not so hard!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beg&mdash;par&mdash;don! Beg&mdash;par&mdash;don!&#8221; continued Pa,
without relenting.</p>
<p>Lily was half-stunned, the world throbbed before her
eyes, and, delirious with wrath, she hissed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I say, I say you shall not marry him! I&#8217;ll kill you
first!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will marry him, yes, yes, I will marry him!
kill me, if you like! God is my witness that I had not
thought of getting married, but, as you say so, I will!&#8221;</p>
<p>His fist closed her mouth. She clasped her arms about
her head, to protect herself as best she could, but soon
sank to the floor, fainting....</p>
<p>For three days she was in bed, broken, dazed&mdash;then,
no sooner on her feet, than off to the theater, guarded
by Pa and Ma. If they could, they would have padlocked
a chain to her ankle and a collar about her neck.
Ma chilled Lily with her scornful pity, or racked her with
repeated insults:</p>
<p>&#8220;A disgrace to the family! You&#8217;ll be the death of us!&#8221;</p>
<p>She would shower cuffs upon Lily, throw books at
her head, or whatever came readiest to hand. Lily hid
the books, the umbrellas, shrank into corners, longing to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
cry; but the tears refused to come. She was too angry.
And, with head down, but eyes alert, she crouched like a
dog rebelling under blows, with lips drawn back above
her teeth, ready to bite.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going out, or I&#8217;ll kill her!&#8221; growled Pa, slamming
the door behind him.</p>
<p>Pa was thoroughly upset: for Lily to leave him! Just
when Hauptmann was starting a fifth troupe; when Pawnee
was drawing full houses with his three stars; when
competition was increasing and threatening: it meant disaster,
certain ruin, the disbanding of his troupe, his contracts
canceled. He seethed with indignation; or else, in
despair, felt like taking Lily in his arms, seating her on
his knee, begging her to tell him that it was all a nightmare,
that she would never marry, never marry that
Trampy: his good little Lily ... whom her Pa
would cover with diamonds! She should have all she
wished, and everything, if only she would assure him that
it was not true that Trampy, that ungrateful cur, whom
he, Pa, had picked out of the gutter, was going to steal
his Lily! That damned Jim Crow! Pa, in his fury,
bought a revolver to scatter the footy rotter&#8217;s brains with,
but Trampy received the tip from Tom and vanished,
hey, presto, leaving no trace, allowing no sign of himself
to crop up anywhere. Pa&#8217;s rage was vented on his
daughter.</p>
<p>Happily for her, Lily now was a model of conduct.
She felt thoroughly calm. Peace seemed to reign in the
house. Lily was such a gentle little thing! One day&mdash;the
very day on which Tom passed her a note from Trampy
and she made a package of her new dress and of her
photographs, and souvenirs&mdash;that evening, as she kissed
her father and mother, tears came to her eyes. Then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
instead of going to the kitchen, she fetched her bundle,
stealthily opened the street-door and ran to the corner,
where Trampy was waiting in a hansom, and hi, off for
the holidays, the champagne, the long-dreamed-of Paradise!</p>

<h2>PLAYING &#8217;EM IN</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
</div>

<p>They were seated on the basket trunk marked, &#8220;Trampy
Wheel-Pad,&#8221; in big black letters. The steamer had left
Harwich and was making for Holland. The English
coast was disappearing in the mist. On the deck, a heap
of luggage and parcels made a sort of nest for them.
Trampy, with his dear little wife by his side, was thinking
of the future ... so many things which he had
flashed before Lily&#8217;s eyes and which he could not give
her ... not directly, at least ... but, pooh,
she&#8217;d get used to it by degrees. The great thing, to
Trampy, was that he had his Lily! He was going to
stuff himself to the throat with love and, first of all, to
seek a shelter for his sweet wife and himself. England
was no place for them. Pa was prowling round and
Jimmy, too. Once their anger was over and they found
themselves face to face with the irreparable, everything
would calm down; meantime, the wisest thing for Trampy
and Lily was to be prudent and run away as fast as they
could. Trampy had his plan, he had seen the agents:
Holland and Belgium first; then a performance at Ludwig&#8217;s
Concert House, in Hamburg, and a brilliant first
appearance before a hall filled with managers. Already
he saw himself in the famous little room of the Café
Grüber, where so many contracts were signed during
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
the few days that the hearing-season lasted, and then he
would have the whole continent, from St. Petersburg to
Lisbon, make heaps of money, treat Lily like the little
peach she was and cover her with diamonds, by Jove!
Trampy, meanwhile, was none too easy in his mind:
funds were low; the two pounds paid at the registrar&#8217;s
office had lightened his purse still more. Fortunately,
the fire-escape had not had his seven-and-six-pence: that
was so much saved.</p>
<p>&#8220;A poor consolation,&#8221; thought Trampy. &#8220;The price of
a dog-license.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he was gay, nevertheless, in his wife&#8217;s company.
He forgot his thirty-six girls. He told Lily stories,
made her squirm with laughter, played with her, dazzled
her with the champagne suppers ... which they
would have later on. Or else, like the consummate mummer
that he was, he put on the gloomy countenance of a
man about to reveal the secret of his heart:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a wretch,&#8221; he muttered, while Lily, in her innocence&mdash;Lily,
who had been living on tenter-hooks since
her flight from home a few days before&mdash;turned her
frightened eyes upon him. &#8220;A miserable wretch ...
married. Yes, it&#8217;s true; I&#8217;m married, Lily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true what they said? You&#8217;re married?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I knew it!&#8221; said Lily, in despair. &#8220;But then
... if you are ... I&#8217;m not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You silly little thing!&#8221; said Trampy, kissing her and
taking her on his knee. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m married; yes; and no
one shall separate us. Haven&#8217;t I the prettiest little wife&mdash;here,
on my knee&mdash;my little Lily?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how you frightened me!&#8221; said Lily, nestling
against him. &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t ever let us part!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>With a wife like that, said Trampy to himself, a little
discomfort more or less made no difference. As long as
she had her dear husband, she would be happy. She
would have eyes for nothing but him and would not care
a fig for all the rest.</p>
<p>Now she loved him: there was no doubt about that.
She had left everything for him! He could even have
had her without marriage, by Jove, and saved two
pounds, if he had insisted! So he thought, at least, and
he put a conquering arm round Lily&#8217;s waist, while she,
with her head on his shoulder, dreamed and dreamed, her
eyes fixed upon the horizon. She was married! She had
dared! She would be, at last, the little lady she had
always been by instinct! And Lily went on building her
castles in Spain until, after the smooth crossing, arriving
at the Hook of Holland, she would not have been surprised
to find her own motor-car and servants waiting
for her on the quay. But no, she had to carry her bag
herself, under the fine drizzle, upon the slippery pavement,
to the train ... and third-class to Rotterdam.
It was all very well for Trampy to adopt a triumphant
air, but Lily was greatly vexed at the idea of going with
her husband to a little hotel frequented by artistes, bill-toppers
though they were. She would have liked something
different.</p>
<p>Trampy observed that, with her Pa....</p>
<p>&#8220;With Pa,&#8221; said Lily, &#8220;it was not the same thing ...
and I&#8217;m not with Pa now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trampy showed himself accommodating. That evening,
Lily had the proud satisfaction of walking into a
smart hotel, with waiters in the hall, as at the Horse
Shoe. She carried her head high, conscious of being
looked at. She would have liked always to shine like that&mdash;to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
sit down to meals amid the rustling of silk dresses
... but she felt uneasy in her modest attire. Trampy
would be only too pleased to give her a new outfit,
later on, yes; but as he explained to Lily, he had had
so many expenses recently, wouldn&#8217;t it be better to take
rooms somewhere, in a sort of place like Lisle Street, or
St. Pauli, at Hamburg? Lily yielded to these arguments,
she had to; but it was a bitter grief for her to leave that
fine hotel, where everybody saw her as a lady ...
perhaps because of her big hat, on which a bird, flat-spread,
opened wide its wings and held in its beak a
diamond the size of an egg.</p>
<p>And, thenceforth, the mean life returned: Lily relapsed
among the potatoes and the wash-hand-basin salads.
There were occasional revolts, tart words, sudden
disputes, which, at times, wrinkled her forehead with
anger....</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she had her good moments: she enjoyed
the sensation of being a lady who does no work, of wearing
gloves and a big hat and of looking at the time on her
fine gold watch while her husband is on the stage. It
seemed pleasant to her no longer to appear before the audience
doing her performing-dog tricks, with Pa scrutinizing
her from the wings. It was her turn now to make
one of the small nation: pas, mas, profs, bosses, brothers,
sisters, sons, daughters, all watching their bread-winners
on the boards. She mingled with them, or else sat down
prettily in a corner, talked to the artistes: other Martellos,
other Nunkies; new faces every week, according to the
theaters they were at: owners of troupes; sketch comedians,
serio-comics; dancers of the Roofer class; laced-up,
glittering &#8220;Mdlles.;&#8221; or else, from time to time, some
josser, a friend of the manager&#8217;s or an agent, prowling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
around among the flesh-colored tights. Lily had seen all
this a hundred times, a thousand times before, when she
was with her parents; and the mere thought of Ma
made her talk nicely, from bravado, to all of them, though
she was married now. Lily bore Pa no malice, in spite
of the buckled belt. Pa was a man, with hair on his
chest and harsh like all of them ... no, not all
... and not so bad, perhaps ... not always
... no; however, a man.... But her Ma, a
lady, ought to have stood up for her! If Ma could see
her now, gee! Lily felt a lump in her throat at the notion.
And it was their fault that she had run away! It served
them right! She was much happier, now, when she was
a lady in her turn. Her talent and her beauty received
the homage due to them. Lily Clifton, the New Zealander,
what ho! A famous name in the profession!
She was one of those whom the stage people point out to
one another:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; she sometimes heard a voice say behind her.
&#8220;Fancy owning a girl like that and not having the sense
to keep her!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily was flattered to the core at hearing her parents
blamed; she felt inclined to rise and say, &#8220;&#8217;K you,&#8221; with
the great stage bow: her right hand on her heart, the
other raising her dress, her body bent forward in a sweeping
curtsey.</p>
<p>She took part in the conversations: she knew a little
Spanish, which she had learned in Mexico, and a little German,
which she had picked up in America from the Three
Graces; and besides they all jabbered English, they were
all &#8220;families,&#8221; &#8220;misses,&#8221; &#8220;the&#8217;s,&#8221; with impossible accents,
suggesting some of those cosmopolitan towns beyond the
&#8220;Rockies.&#8221; In this medley, she was at her ease; but she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
did not at all like being called Lily, now that she was a
lady:</p>
<p>&#8220;Call me Mrs. Trampy,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>After the show, she would sit in the restaurant with
Trampy. There, amid clouds of tobacco-smoke, they all
supped in a crowd. There were separate tables, at which
silent little parties gobbled down their cutlets and compote
in ten minutes and then slipped away quietly. Sometimes,
a whole band of girls would swoop down at once,
like a flight of thrushes, or exchange funny remarks
over other people&#8217;s heads and blow volleys of kisses in
every direction.</p>
<p>Trampy, always full of good stuff, amused the company.
He lorded it in the select corner, the corner of
the stage-manager and the pretty girls. After supper, he
cocked a cigar between his teeth and told thick stories
in the midst of an admiring throng. Lily followed with
her lips, so as not to lose a word, but, when the final
point was at hand, she blushed in advance, turned away
her head, as though tired of listening without understanding,
and talked to her neighbor, like a lady who
respects herself. Or, sometimes, it was more than she
could help and Lily would laugh and laugh:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! Oh, my!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they would &#8220;talk shop&#8221; among pros, they passed
one another the papers: <i>Der Artist, The Era, Das Program</i>,
they discussed engagements, quoted personal anecdotes:
the Ma who made her star go down to the kitchen,
lest the landlady, when peeling the potatoes, should slip
one into her pocket. Yes, her own daughter, a star who
brought her in a hundred marks a day!</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just like it!&#8221; thought Lily.</p>
<p>They made fun of that prof who pinched his apprentices
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
till the blood came, while pretending to smile, or
clawed them like a monkey. And the company laughed
and laughed, especially when Trampy put out his hand
to Lily to show her how the monkeys ... Lily
would jump back and the crowd roared with laughter.
And the glasses of beer and Moselwein accumulated on
the table; and round backs were bent over interminable
games of cards....</p>
<p>And then, gradually, the room emptied; the girls went
away and Lily, waiting for her husband, sank into her
chair and yawned as though her jaws would drop. As
they left, she reproached Trampy for his coarseness:
those horrid stories which made her blush before everybody&#8217;s
eyes. Her Pa would never have permitted himself
... She was not accustomed ...</p>
<p>&#8220;That didn&#8217;t keep you from splitting your sides with
laughter,&#8221; said Trampy.</p>
<p>&#8220;What an idea!&#8221; replied Lily, in a vexed tone. &#8220;Do
you think I&#8217;m going to play the goody goody &#8216;lalerperlooser&#8217;?
One has to do as others do and not make one&#8217;s
self conspicuous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right!&#8221; said Trampy.</p>
<p>But she turned crimson with rage when Trampy, some
other night, forgot himself so far as to monkey-claw the
girls. There were short violent scenes when they returned
home, chairs upset, angry words. Trampy could
not understand this jealousy. When he was confronted
with these outbursts, he was greatly surprised, sought for
a reason, muttered Jimmy&#8217;s name&mdash;that was his sensitive
point: he thought of it in spite of himself&mdash;ironically
inquired of Lily if it was Jimmy who had put all that
nonsense into her head. Lily was sorry to see the conversation
take this turn. She flung her arms round her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
husband&#8217;s neck, loved him, kissed him prettily, the great
silly: he knew better; he knew she never thought of
Jimmy:</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiss me, darling! I wish you would make me happy,&#8221;
said Lily, moved to pity for herself. &#8220;I want to be a
good little wife!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon they made it up. Lily did not feel, with her
husband, that thrill which she had often noticed in other
women: but she wanted to love him, stubbornly pursued
the idea, fagged away at her love like a little school-girl
only too anxious to learn. Trampy, on his side, could be
amiable when he liked. He became the old Trampy again
at times and treated Lily like a little playfellow. They
would both run about in the <i>Biergarten</i>, in the morning,
at practice-time, larking like children, hiding behind the
tables, and their laughter enlivened the empty place, still
soiled with the remnants of last night&#8217;s meal and littered
with programs and cigar-stumps.</p>
<p>And time passed like this for weeks ... it was
months now ... an existence like another, with
good in it and bad ... and monotonous and common....</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have been better off, perhaps, at home,&#8221; she
thought. &#8220;If this is marriage, it&#8217;s not much.&#8221;</p>
<p>For, she saw it quite clearly, <i>that</i> wasn&#8217;t love; Trampy
didn&#8217;t understand her. A &#8220;girl&#8221; and a wife were all the
same to Trampy: a mere pastime, both of them. He spoke
of it lightly, through the smoke of his cigar. She learned
to know him, heard him boast of his prowess, caught
passing words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls, girls, my!&#8221;</p>
<p>She would have laughed, she would even have felt
flattered at being chosen among so many, if he had put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
an end to his conquests. But he continued to prowl
round the stage-girls, as he used to do before he was
married. If even he had shone upon the stage, she would
have understood that he had got &#8220;swelled head,&#8221; that he
was yielding to temptation; but his success was only
middling. He had not made a hit at Hamburg. The
manager of Ludwig&#8217;s had told him flatly that he would
do well to practise and practise a great deal. Trampy
posed as a victim of jealousy, spoke of showing them&mdash;all
of them, if once he put his back to it!&mdash;a new turn,
a discovery that would show what he was made of!
Meanwhile he had a new idea, as a sketch comedian, with
a make-up of his own invention, the face painted white
on one side and red on the other, with wrinkles cunningly
drawn&mdash;a laughing Johnny and a crying Johnny, two
men in one. He pestered Lily with his plans, made her
cut out dresses for him, came back from the old-clothes
shop laden with uniforms in rags, into which Lily had
to put patches. And shoes, in particular, ran in his head;
shoes of which the soles and the uppers yawned like lips;
talking shoes, which said, &#8220;Papa!&#8221; and &#8220;Mamma!&#8221; This
last suggestion made Lily laugh.</p>
<p>Trampy haunted the bazaars, bought children&#8217;s toys,
took the stomachs out of the cardboard dogs and rabbits
to make his quackers, sought about for his right note,
pursued inspiration to the bottom of the glasses.</p>
<p>Lily was sometimes driven to exasperation. This
tramp-cyclist, this sketch-comedian was making her, Lily
Clifton, patch up his dresses! And her husband rewarded
her for it by making love to the girls, poor idiot!
Oh, if Pa and Ma had not been so harsh with her! Lily
always harked back to that, stiffened herself with the
thought, remembered the Marjutti girl, in whom love of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
art produced wonders and whose Pa and Ma were so
gentle and kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should have treated me like that,&#8221; she concluded,
&#8220;and I should have been at home still!&#8221;</p>
<p>She regretted her marriage. And there were some who
pitied her for belonging to Trampy: they looked upon him
as not worthy of her, blamed him for openly carrying on
with girls. Others asked, as though it did not matter,
was she really married or were they just &#8220;living together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Am I married? Is that what they think
about me?&#8221; she said, a little annoyed. &#8220;Of course I am!
At the Kennington registry-office!&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet a doubt entered her mind too. Was she really
married, after all? Lily did not know much about it.
Had the banns been published? And those two witnesses
picked up in the street ... a ceremony that took
just five minutes ... like a conjuring trick. If it
was true that they were &#8220;living together&#8221; without her
knowing it, she would not stay with him. She would
go back home at once. Marriage, certainly, was never
intended for her. This she realized now. When she
thought of the Gilson girl, mad on her man, and of others
whom she sometimes caught in the dressing-rooms and
passages eating each other up with kisses, she was at a
loss to understand. How could they make so much fuss
about it?</p>
<p>Poor little wife, with so little love for her husband and
no admiration at all! As an artiste she thought him
lamentable. Trampy, who had seemed so great to her
in Mexico ... why, she had shot miles ahead of
him since! She felt that he was getting second-rate. He
himself was well aware of it, for that matter; blamed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
everybody: suspected a hoodoo somewhere: some son of
a gun bringing him ill-luck. And he was always casting
about for an easy means of success ... another
new plan ... always something new ... a
high-sounding title: &#8220;Rusty Bike,&#8221; an old jigger which,
at each turn of the wheel, would grate like a cart,
&#8220;Crrrra! Crrrra!&#8221; and bring the house down with laughter,
while Lily, in the wings, was to sound an accompaniment
on a grating rattle:</p>
<p>&#8220;Crrrra! Crrrra!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All that set-out for nothing!&#8221; said Lily to herself.
&#8220;It would be much simpler to have a little talent.&#8221;</p>
<p>She felt herself overcome with contempt for her husband:
what a sorry bread-winner he made! Why take a
wife, when you had only that to keep her on? Lily did not
know whether to laugh or to cry when she saw Trampy
come down from his dressing-room, proud as a peacock,
his chest swelling at the sight of so many girls at a time,
a treat of which he never wearied. He was magnificent,
was Trampy, against that background of shoulders, thighs
and calves: in his element as a fish in water. Nor did
he make any bones about smiling to them or monkey-clawing
them as they came off the stage. The presence
of his wife did not hinder him. He was sure of her
love: he knew she must adore him, as all the others
did. And, leaving Lily in a corner, in the shade of a pillar,
with his eyes he devoured all that powdered flesh, all
those coarse wigs.</p>
<p>Lily hated him at such times. She could have boxed
his ears. She had enough of it, at last. One evening, she
caught hold of his arm to take him away, furious that a
gentleman could find a pleasure in making his wife look
so ridiculous! And Trampy, more or less flattered at
what he considered a fond wife&#8217;s jealousy, was turning to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
go, when a lady with plumes on her head and a woolly
dog under her arm greeted him with:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, old boy! Glad to see you, Trampy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily&mdash;it was a distant memory, but no matter&mdash;recognized
Poland, the Parisienne, with the painted face and
the violent scent. Trampy took a step backward. He
expected a scene, though he owed her nothing, after all;
but she did not seem angry, no. On the contrary, she
looked at him with a roguish eye. She knew of Trampy&#8217;s
marriage, no doubt, as she knew of his conquests, having
been his victim herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, old boy!&#8221; repeated Poland, sizing up Lily with
an appraising glance and then fixing her eyes upon
Trampy. &#8220;Still having your successes, old boy? Is this
your number thirty? Thirty-six? Thirty-eight, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; Lily broke in, astounded at these manners.
&#8220;What number thirty-six, thirty-eight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh! A number in a lottery,&#8221; said Trampy, looking
quite vain between those two women in love with him.
&#8220;Yes, a number ... with which I drew a prize!...
Why, by Jove,&#8221; he continued, addressing Poland,
&#8220;this is my wife!... Lily Clifton! ... the
New Zealander on Wheels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Poland to Lily. &#8220;I did hear that you
ran away: tired of this, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>And, tapping the back of her left hand with the palm
of her right, she made the professional gesture that denotes
a whipping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was a bit,&#8221; said Lily, feeling rather proud than
otherwise. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been through the mill, I have!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had your fair share, eh?&#8221; insisted Poland.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not the first that has left her family to escape
being whipped. You did quite right,&#8221; she concluded.</p>
<p>Trampy was dumfounded and utterly floored by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
revelation. What! He! He! Lily had married him
because of that! Because ... And people said it!
And talked about it!</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Lily,&#8221; said Trampy. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, giving no further heed to Poland, who followed
him with a mocking smile, he took Lily by the arm and
went out with her.</p>
<p>Lily felt her arm shake. Trampy was furious, evidently.
She saw her mistake, too late. There would be
a stormy scene when they got in. Well, who cared?
She was resolved, under that obstinate forehead of hers,
to face the facts. She had had enough of this husband.
And she meant to know, that very moment, if she was
married or not ... because with him one never
knew. When she admitted that she had married him
because of &#8220;that,&#8221; Trampy, in his humiliation would put
her out of doors at once; if the marriage wasn&#8217;t valid,
he would get rid of her. There was no doubt about it.</p>
<p>And she did not have to wait, for Trampy, even before
they were out of the theater, in the passage, among the
trunks and properties, Trampy, unable to restrain himself
any longer, seized her by the wrists and looked her
straight in the face:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it true?&#8221; he asked, in a voice trembling with rage.</p>
<p>Lily, without replying, lowered her eyes as though to
say yes, like a good little wife, oh, <i>so</i> sorry to offend
her husband!</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; said Trampy, choking with shame, &#8220;you married
me for &#8216;that:&#8217; me, Trampy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Lily confusedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn you!&#8221; cried Trampy. &#8220;Oh, if we weren&#8217;t married
for good, wouldn&#8217;t I just make you sleep out to-night!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>Poor Lily! She was Trampy&#8217;s little wife, his little
wife for ever! And life, monotonous and common, followed
its usual course: a week here, a week there; and
the theater every night at the fixed time, according to the
scene-plot which they went and consulted on reaching the
stage: &#8220;X, Corridor, 9.5; Z, Wood, 10.17; Y, Palace,
11.10,&#8221; and so on. And for Trampy it was an everlasting
grumbling at his ill-luck, a dull anger at &#8220;playing
&#8217;em in,&#8221; so sure was he of seeing his name first, always&mdash;&#8220;Garden,
8.30, Trampy Wheel-Pad&#8221;&mdash;he who had had
such a success in England with his red-hot stove. It
was no use his saying to himself that it wouldn&#8217;t last,
that it would be better next week. It was just as though
done on purpose. He played &#8217;em in, always, from Bremen
to Brunswick, from Leipzig to Madgeburg:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I knew the son of a gun who has his knife into
me!&#8221; growled Trampy, persuaded that he was the victim
of an agent&#8217;s jealousy, or else the stage-managers didn&#8217;t
understand their business.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had more talent,&#8221; thought Lily to herself, &#8220;that
sort of thing wouldn&#8217;t happen. I&#8217;d like to see you with
Pa: <i>he&#8217;d</i> show you, <i>he&#8217;d</i> make you stir your stumps, you
rusty biker!&#8221;</p>
<p>However, she was careful not to say so to him, for fear
of blows; and Lily knew that, if ever she received them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
once, twice, without returning them, it was all up with
her, she would lapse under the yoke again, it would become
a habit: there would be nothing for it but to leave
her husband, if she wished to avoid slaps, just as she had
left her family, to avoid whippings.</p>
<p>That would have been too grotesque. She did not want
to give Pa and Ma the satisfaction of seeing her unhappily
married. Lily armed herself with patience; and she
needed it! Trampy was in a frightful temper, said that
he would have been the ideal husband, if she had been
the little wife he had dreamed of: but to think that she
had married him for &#8220;that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now it was the constant allusion to &#8220;that&#8221; which made
him die with shame. Everywhere, on the stages of the
different music-halls, people had for Lily that sort of
sympathetic pity which they feel for a performing dog:
they approved of her running away; everybody seemed
to know about it. Poland, it must be said, scored a fine
revenge against Trampy, without counting the artistes
who had seen Lily practising and who knew what harsh
treatment meant, the Munich Roofers, among others, real
ones, with their blows of the hat, gee!</p>
<p>Among them, it became the fashion, when they saw
Lily, to tap the back of their hands, and then to applaud
with the tip of the nail, as though to approve her flight.
Lily at first was annoyed at the reputation for cruelty
which they were giving her Pa. He was right to hit her,
she thought, sometimes. She was also annoyed on her
own account. She was an artiste, damn it! It was not
only a question of smackings! Why, if she hadn&#8217;t had
it in her...! It was a gift! But, on the other
hand, to excuse the folly of her marriage, she let them
talk, without protesting, like a poor little thing who would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
still be with her Pa and Ma if she had been treated
&#8220;fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there were always angry disputes between her and
Trampy. They were seen to disappear through the stage-entrance,
Lily with an arrogant air, Trampy drooping
his head, his lips distorted with stinging replies. Lily,
though she was not performing at the theater, sometimes
received a letter there. When there was one for her in
the heap of envelopes, bearing the stamps of all countries,
which had been round the world prior to &#8220;waiting arrival&#8221;
in the doorkeeper&#8217;s pigeonholes, Trampy looked
at her furiously, wanted to know. Lily refused. Forthwith,
in the passages, or on the stage, endless disputes
went on between them ... oh, not in the least tragic
in appearance and interlarded with &#8220;Hullo, boys!&#8221; and
&#8220;Hullo, girls!&#8221; to left and right, whenever they passed
any acquaintances. And in a low voice, abruptly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Show it to me, you wench!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, you footy rotter!&#8221;</p>
<p>Trampy could not forgive Lily for marrying him on
that account. He, who had only to choose among the
crowd that walks the boards or flutters about in muslin
skirts, suffered from Lily&#8217;s scorn, looked upon himself
as a sultan dethroned before the eyes of his harem. In
order to infuriate Lily, though he did not feel in the
least like laughing, he exaggerated his conquering ways.
It ended by affecting his work. Only the night before,
he had got drunk with two &#8220;sisters&#8221; out of ten: the
fourth and seventh from the right. Result: he was still
in bed when the matinée began. And his performance
went so badly that they had to drop the curtain on him.
That would pass for once: an illness was allowable; but it
couldn&#8217;t go on at that rate. He was becoming worse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
than the head-balancer who tumbled off his perch, without
having his excuse of sorrow, the loss of a beloved
wife, seeing that he, Trampy, had a dear little wife and
very much alive, this one!</p>
<p>Lily, in her calmer moments, foresaw that they would
soon have to face hard times, flat poverty. She felt her
contempt for Trampy increase. Those sketch-comedians,
those tramp cyclists, pooh, they were less than
nothing, bluff, that&#8217;s all, as old Martello said!</p>
<p>She saw her dreams flung to the ground. At first, it
had been charming for her, so full of novelty, but, after
all, she had only changed masters. She ended by considering
herself more unhappy than she had been with Pa and
Ma. To begin with, Pa always had money. She brought
them in a lot. She lived much less comfortably with
Trampy. She used to think that being a married woman
would change everything, whereas&mdash;not a bit of it!&mdash;there
was no change at all: potatoes, coal, all sorts of
dirty, messy things; and no Maud to help her. And it
was always as in the old days: damp sheets, dirty glasses,
rickety tables, beds with worn-out mattresses; and the
nights were dull as ditch-water. Trampy had hoped for
something different, expected to find a whole harem in
Lily, his thirty-six girls in one, including Ave Maria,
with her body like a wildcat&#8217;s. Alas, it was far from
that!</p>
<p>Lily loathed those nights. Love, yes, but not that, not
that! Sacred love, not profane love (Lily had seen paintings
of it in museums and remembered the title). Love,
that is to say, to lie ever so nicely on the breast of the dear
one, yes, as with Glass-Eye, and dream of hats and diamonds.
No doubt, it was ambitious to want so much. She,
who had seen everything, had never come across that;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
but it was what she wanted, what she had been promised,
damn it! Things were going from bad to worse. Memories
of her childhood moved her almost to tears, when
she thought of it: those happy times in Africa, on the
straw beside the horses, the stars seen through the tent
and the smell of the elephants. When she was there, perhaps
that had seemed less sweet to her: the hard ground,
the noise of the chains; but everything was made more
poetic by remembrance: it was the past, what! Nights
sweet as milk, far from a man reeking of tobacco. And
not only her early childhood, but her life of yesterday returned
to her: touring with the troupe, the oatmeal porridge
and the cakes she made&mdash;bricks!&mdash;but Pa laughed
at them, took them good-humoredly, whereas Trampy
lost his temper. In those days, it is true, she wasn&#8217;t a
lady, she used to work; but they had good fun, all the
same, in the dressing-rooms; they had tea at the theater,
romps in the passages, or else did crochet-work, to pass
the time; and all those practical jokes, intensified by distance:
hustling Glass-Eye into the hamper; coaxing the
black cat into the dressing-room, for luck; or making
the pantomime lady speak her tag; or going in to the
Roofers, on some pretext, and giving a whistle which
made them all rush out, dressed or undressed or half-dressed,
never mind, and spin round three times to ward
off the ill omen: all those memories touched her till she
felt inclined to cry. Oh, if she had been with her Pa
now, she would have sat down on his knee and begged
his pardon!</p>
<p>At such times, if Trampy became affectionate and tried
to kiss his little wife, Lily would simply turn her back
on him. Poor Trampy! And he could not play the master!
For, call on the agents as he might and write as many fine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
letters as he pleased&mdash;an art in which he excelled&mdash;work
was becoming scarce. He no longer had any money. One
pay-day, Trampy was obliged to confess that he had had
his salary in advance and spent it; a money-lender held
his contract and kept back three-quarters of his pay.
Trampy, tormented by urgent needs, had let himself in
with a Brixton &#8220;financier,&#8221; a specialist in &#8220;loans from five
pounds upward, music-hall artistes treated with the
strictest confidence,&#8221; who pocketed nearly the whole.
Now Lily just happened to want a new dress, a new petticoat
and a tiny mother-of-pearl lucky charm. Trampy
had to own that he couldn&#8217;t afford these fancies and Lily
had a fit of temper! But then why promise so many
things to a poor little wife who deserved better than that?</p>
<p>&#8220;A poor little wife,&#8221; said Trampy, &#8220;should marry her
husband for love and not to escape whippings! There are
ups and downs in the profession. It was your own lookout;
you shouldn&#8217;t have married a star!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A star!&#8221; cried Lily, with a nervous laugh. &#8220;You a
star! A damned comedian! A nice sort of star, indeed!
A music-hall could have twenty black cats in it and you&#8217;d
turn them into a white elephant!&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, Trampy, according to her, was a Jonah,
good only for playing the people in, if that!</p>
<p>&#8220;A wife has no right to speak to her husband as you
do!&#8221; exclaimed Trampy, leaping up under the insult.
&#8220;You deserve a good thrashing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None of that!&#8221; said Lily angrily, ready to fly at his
throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;A wife,&#8221; resumed Trampy, with great dignity, &#8220;helps
her husband, instead of insulting him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in for it, I suppose!&#8221; said Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, we&#8217;re in for it! I have no engagement now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
but that&#8217;s no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t find one. Look
for one and work!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily was in for it, knee-deep, as she said. She was not
excessively astonished: it was the inevitable end! Not
that she disliked to work: her idleness, on the contrary,
was beginning to pall upon her; but it was the humiliation
of going back to it after putting on so much side and
posing as the lady. She had worked for Pa; now she
would work for Trampy; it was natural and proper.
There were exceptions&mdash;the wife at home, as Jimmy said,
that josser!&mdash;but they were rare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take up your bike again,&#8221; said Trampy, after a pause.
&#8220;Be a good little wife, help me out of this. I have something
in my mind, a scheme which will make us rich;
you&#8217;ll see later on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Lily, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t a stage bike, and yours is
really too ugly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know of one for sale.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;ll work,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make them give
me this tour which they promised you and didn&#8217;t sign for;
and to-morrow you shall see!&#8221;</p>
<p>At heart, Lily was not sorry to show her husband how
people got out of a scrape, when they had talent; and, the
next day, she went to an agent, accompanied by Trampy,
looking very dignified. Her cheeky feather was made
to dance attendance for a moment; and then she was
shown into the office. Lily Clifton? The New Zealander
on Wheels? Straight away a contract, signed in duplicate!
A week in each town; later on, perhaps, a month
in Berlin, at the Kolossal. Lily displayed wonderful tact,
did not triumph too openly over Trampy. She acted to
perfection the part of the little lady who takes up the
bike again just for fun&mdash;as in the time of her &#8220;French
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
governess&#8221;&mdash;or rather of a dear little thing wholly
wrapped up now in her wifely duty: her poor husband
ill, she herself needing exercise, just for fun, you know.</p>
<p>On leaving the agent&#8217;s, she bought some material,
then ran home, cut out stage dresses. In the evening,
Lily was still hemming and stitching, indefatigably,
seized once more with professional pride after her excursions
into private life. And, all night, under the
lamp, she contrived, cut out and sewed. Then came practice,
without Pa. In an hour, in spite of the new machine,
which put her out, she had picked up her &#8220;times&#8221;
again. She felt as if she had been spinning round the
night before, under Pa&#8217;s eye, so absolutely at her ease
was she, with her head on the saddle or twirling on the
back-wheel.</p>
<p>And, on the following Monday, her first appearance, her
name on the walls: &#8220;Miss Lily&#8221; in big letters, right at the
top of the posters, &#8220;Miss Lily,&#8221; not &#8220;Mrs.&#8221; or &#8220;Madame.&#8221;
Had she had ten children, two husbands and three divorces,
she would still have been &#8220;Miss,&#8221; everywhere and
always, as a further attraction for the swells in the front
boxes and as a certificate of youth. Mighty few husbands,
on the continent especially; not more men of any
kind than could be helped, on the stage, except a few
noted &#8220;profs,&#8221; standing by the perches of velvet and steel
or under the trapezes, displaying, beside the pink-silk
tights, against the &#8220;palace&#8221; back-drop, the faultless correctness
of their full-dress suits. But, for the rest, people
preferred to ignore husbands, brothers and &#8220;friends;&#8221;
Lily had known some who never showed themselves at
all, who remained squatting at home, so as not to stand
in their wives&#8217; way.</p>
<p>Trampy, for that matter, knew better than to parade
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
himself with Lily. And he preferred it so. He could
have wished one thing to the exclusion of all others: that
people should not know of his marriage, that they should
cease to speak of it. Unfortunately, this was not to be.
The story of the whippings was enlivening Lisle Street,
exaggerated, as usual. The Bill and Boom tour, the Harrasford
tour were beginning to spread it on every stage in
England; before six months were over, it would have
made the round of the world from the Klondike to Calcutta.
What a disgrace for Trampy! Yet no sooner had
he put his New Zealander on her wheels again than
Trampy blossomed out once more. After all, who cared
if people were seen to smack the back of their hands?
He wasn&#8217;t to be put out by a little thing like that:</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; he seemed to say. &#8220;We are married, whippings
or no whippings, and I am the master; I have set
her to work again; and there you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>Trampy&#8217;s reputation, so far from suffering, increased;
all his compeers now envied him from the bottom of their
hearts; the bosses, the profs, the managers, the Pas, the
Mas treated him, in their own minds, as a lucky dog, all
the more inasmuch as Trampy was not uppish and gladly
stood drinks, while his wife, &#8220;Miss Lily,&#8221; made money
for him with her breakneck tricks. It was much smarter
than doing it for one&#8217;s self: the great thing was to have
a &#8220;girl&#8221; like that! Trampy was having his revenge: he
had been laughed at; he now had the laugh on them! and
Trampy knew glorious times, in the <i>Biergarten</i>, or lounging
at street-corners, near the stage-door, chaffing the
girls, hat cocked back, hands deep in his pockets, a cigar
stuck between his teeth. He told the story of his life, not
without pride; said that he must write it one day, sell it to
<i>The New York Standard</i> for a thousand dollars. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
girls <i>he&#8217;d</i> had: whew! His love adventures: all over the
world, by Jove! And his marriage with Lily Clifton, the
New Zealander on Wheels, a dear little wife, so gentle,
so obedient. No, he had no reason to complain of his
life. He would write it, mark his words! To say nothing
of a scheme he had in mind:</p>
<p>&#8220;Just you wait and see! It&#8217;s a trick to make a millionaire
of you or break your neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you make Miss Lily do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see, I&#8217;ll think it over,&#8221; said Trampy, in a lordly
tone.</p>
<p>The directors, the stage-managers took no notice of
him; but, among the artistes, Trampy Wheel-Pad was
some one, he enjoyed his leisure, recovered his self-assurance:
if, in addition, he could have destroyed the legend
of the whippings, he would have been perfectly happy.
He would turn the conversation on the subject of smackings
in the music-hall generally, in the hope of hearing
them contradicted or made little of; but it was no use;
every one believed in them: all, boys and girls, even the
most spoiled, quoted facts: blows which they had received!
my! blows hard enough to split the front of a
music-hall from top to bottom! The nation with the
painted faces, the blue-chins seemed to vie with one another
as to who had been most through the mill.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re exaggerating,&#8221; said Trampy. &#8220;It may be true,
to a certain extent, in your case. But, Miss Lily, for instance:
do you mean to say you believe all she tells?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, quite!&#8221; said two Roofer girls who were there.</p>
<p>They had seen Lily practising. And they knew what it
meant. They had had their share, too: old Roofer, gee!
And Lily had done quite right to run away from her
whippings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There you go again!&#8221; said Trampy. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see
she&#8217;s humbugging you?&#8221;</p>

TRAMPY ENJOYED HIS LEISURE<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>But he pulled himself up suddenly,
if Lily arrived, for, in
spite of his big airs, he was all
submission in her presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, really! Glass-Eye caught
it instead of me, I suppose,&#8221; said
Lily, drawing back her shoulder
as though threatening to smack
him, &#8220;when Pa went for me with
his leather belt. And I have witnesses.
I&#8217;ve been through the
mill, if anybody has: that much
I <i>can</i> say!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily, after this burst of pride,
would lower her head, a trifle
embarrassed, like a dear little
thing, all wrapped up in her duties
as a wife, a wife whom her
husband would cause to break
her back one of these days, perhaps.</p>
<p>This created a circle of admirers
around her: all, besides,
agreed in saying that you had to
have the business &#8220;rubbed into
your skin&#8221; to be as clever as she
was.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;K you!&#8221; said Lily, with a
stage bow.</p>
<p>It was certain that she made
a hit. They wanted her everywhere.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
She was asked to appear in tights. The engagements
grew better and better. &#8220;Miss Lily&#8221; was more
and more talked about. It was no longer a Trampy
Wheel-Pad on a rusty bike: it was grace, youth ...
and stage-smiles fit to turn the heads in the front boxes.
When Lily appeared on the stage, she transfixed every
white shirt-front, every opera-glass. She took a real delight
in it all. Her beauty captivated the audience. In
her pink tights, Lily turned and turned and turned, to
the hum of the orchestra, against the &#8220;wood&#8221; back-drop
of purple and gold. Then she returned to the wings, all
excited by her show, received bouquets, chatted freely
with the comrades. She met old friends: the green-eyed
female-impersonator, for instance, pressed her
closely. He, too, was touring Germany: a week here, a
week there. Chance brought them together again. He
was enraptured by Lily: how lovely she had grown! He
would have liked to adopt her.... Lily threw her
head back, laughed and repelled him with a thump in the
ribs when he tried to kiss her.</p>
<p>Another time, she saw the Bambinis, who were playing,
by a lucky accident, at matinées only and by special
permission, because of their age. She larked with them
like a child. Elsewhere, it was Nunkie Fuchs, on his way
to Vienna, where he was going to see to the building of
his pigeon-house, leaving the Three Graces for a few
weeks on the Harrasford tour. He had seen Lily&#8217;s name
on the posters and had come to say, &#8220;How do you do?&#8221;
to her.</p>
<p>And, amid the thunder of the band or the lull of the
<i>entr&#8217;actes</i>, Lily received tidings of her Pa and Ma and
details of what happened after her flight, as reported by
Glass-Eye Maud. After Lily&#8217;s departure, they had hunted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
everywhere. Then Ma thought of looking in the trunk:
the pretty dress was gone. Then they had rushed to the
theater: no Lily. Then they had guessed: Lily had run
away. Ma fell on her knees and cried and cried. Pa
seized his revolver and spoke of going to shoot the man
who had robbed him of his child! His little Lily gone!
And the contracts had to be canceled and Pa did not go
out for a week and the house remained still and silent
for a month. Pa, thoroughly upset, cried whenever
Lily&#8217;s name was mentioned and was near dying of shame
when he felt himself blamed, even by those who used to
congratulate him on his way of turning out an artiste.
And Nunkie himself maintained that one must know how
to handle young girls: gentleness above all.</p>
<p>Lily bit her lips when she heard that. Her little nose
tingled. She hardened her features, wrinkled her obstinate
forehead, lest she also should cry:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had to do it again, I would!&#8221; she said quickly,
just like that, without reflecting, in the way one says a
thing to one&#8217;s self which one knows to be untrue.</p>
<p>They also told her things that made her laugh. Glass-Eye
Maud no longer left her hole, cried like a tap, so
much so that one day, Ma, noticing an insipid taste in
the porridge, threatened her with the sack if that sort of
thing went on.</p>
<p>As for business, people did not know exactly. Pa, they
said, had written to a Hauptmann&#8217;s &#8220;fat freak&#8221; to take
Lily&#8217;s place. The reply ran:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks, I&#8217;m all right where I am.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Fat Freak</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The signature was underlined, for people had ended by
knowing about Pa&#8217;s disrespectful remarks. Lily laughed
when she heard this: my!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will come ... when you take to wearing
braces!&#8221; another had answered.</p>
<p>This was an allusion to the blows with the belt; and
Lily, with head thrown back, full-throated, her hand on
her heart, laughed ... laughed ... laughed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo, girls!&#8221; she said, applauding with her thumbnail.</p>
<p>And Tom? Tom had had the boot, with a bang on the
nose, for carrying letters to Lily. For Pa ended by learning
all: some one had told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy, that son of a gun!&#8221; said Lily.</p>
<p>And Jimmy himself, what had become of that josser?
Jimmy was no longer stage-manager. He had left everything
after Lily&#8217;s flight. He, too, had flown into a terrible
rage when he heard about it ... spoke of
Trampy as a thief in the night ... would have
killed him, if he had met him ... and he was going
to star in his turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Singing?&#8221; asked Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, something to do with the bike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a fool!&#8221; thought Lily. &#8220;Fancies himself an
artiste because he used to mend my bike for me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy, it seemed, had hired a huge shed and there, all
alone, fitted up some apparatus of a complicated kind.
He never went out by day. He worked and worked. A
trick to break your neck at, it appeared, or make your
fortune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those jossers!&#8221; exclaimed Lily scornfully.</p>
<p>And what was he going to do on his bike? Nobody
knew. There was something published in the papers, they
said. It was something on the back-wheel.</p>
<p>&#8220;What rot!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily laughed open-mouthed, laughed with all her muscles,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
twisting her hips, splitting her sides, smacking her
thighs. What! Jimmy on the back-wheel! He! He!
He cutting twirls, that josser!</p>
<p>&#8220;And the troupe?&#8221;</p>
<p>The troupe nobody knew about: dispersed, most likely;
the troupe, after all, was Lily. When she went, everything
was bound to fall to pieces. Pa didn&#8217;t care either;
told any one who would listen to him that he was going
to retire to Kennington, that he was well off now ...
thousands of pounds in the bank ... made his fortune
... meant to live on his dividends.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; said Lily; &#8220;I knew I had made his fortune!
Thousands of pounds, damn it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily, don&#8217;t swear like that!&#8221; said Nunkie Fuchs. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not right!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily lowered her head, taken aback; excused herself,
like a lady who knows her manners:</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;if he had had my troubles,
that old rogue, perhaps he would have sworn, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>For Trampy was becoming terrible: life was impossible
with him. All the money which Lily earned went on
champagne ... and on girls, probably; and the
more she earned the greedier he grew. He wanted money,
heaps of money; Lily had nothing left for herself. Trampy
sought out new tricks, invented balancing-feats, made her
practise them, in the morning, on the stage, with his
sleeves turned back and his trousers turned up, absolutely
like a Pa. Lily, accustomed to yield obedience, relapsed
under the yoke. Bike in the morning, bike at the matinée,
bike in the evening; and, with that, the cooking, the
washing-up ... and not a farthing in her pocket,
though she had made a fortune for her Pa, damn it! Pa
living on his income at Kennington, while she continued
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
her life of slavery! Wasn&#8217;t it enough to make her send
everybody to the devil, and Nunkie, that old rogue, with
the rest? A pack of nigger drivers, that&#8217;s what they
were, every one of them! And what an idiot she was,
to keep on barking her shins for other people! Would
she go on doing it until she was fifty? And if she didn&#8217;t
begin now to put money by, who would do it for her
later? Not that worthless husband, surely! He, who,
that very morning, had dared, the loafer, to tell her of a
scheme&mdash;a sort of a risky trick which she was to perform,
a thing calculated to break your head or make a
millionaire of you&mdash;for him, of course, just as for Pa!
It had come to this, that her turn wasn&#8217;t good enough,
that it had to be more sensational; and she was expected
to make it so for a man she didn&#8217;t love! Oh, she had
put him nicely in his place! Rather! Thank you for
nothing: none of that for her! In the evening Lily was
still trembling, with her two elbows on the table, as she
sat facing her glass in her dressing-room; angrily she
crushed the grease-paint on to her cheeks, which were
pale with rage.</p>
<p>Ting! Straight on to the stage, turning round and
round, fifty rounds from habit, mechanically, without any
&#8220;go&#8221; in them: an indolent performance, which would have
earned her a good smacking in Pa&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were shockingly bad!&#8221; said Trampy, who was
waiting for her in the bar, after watching her from the
front. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you? Are you ill?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily did not even answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m speaking to you,&#8221; said Trampy crossly. &#8220;You
did nothing right to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know; that&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Lily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a question of &#8216;Yes, I know,&#8217; but of doing better
next time,&#8221; said Trampy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not taking any orders to-night,&#8221; said Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, darling, but there was an agent in the house. He
must have thought you bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s none of your business!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, if you don&#8217;t get engagements, what&#8217;s to become
of us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a hang,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;<i>I</i> can always manage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ... you ... and what about me? We&#8217;re
married, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the money I earn&#8217;s mine,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;I mean to
buy dresses and whatever I want to, with <i>my</i> money.
You&#8217;ll be wanting to come on the stage next, in evening-dress,
to stand over me while I do my turn, and getting
out your belt. Do you take me for your daughter, tell
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m saying,&#8221; said Trampy, aghast, &#8220;is for your
good, from the point of view of the business, the salary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>My</i> business, <i>my</i> salary, damn it!&#8221; cried Lily. &#8220;<i>Mine,
mine</i>, do you understand? And it concerns nobody but
myself!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p>It came as a smack in the jaw to Trampy.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>My</i> pay, <i>my</i> work, <i>mine</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>It meant no more pocket-money with which to lord it at
the bar. It meant a cheap cigarette instead of his glorious
cigar. It was the end of a beautiful dream; and the
awakening was a hard one. At first, he hoped to make
Lily jealous by going about openly with the stage-girls;
but she no longer paid any attention, seemed to suggest
that he had better amuse himself on his side and she on
hers:</p>
<p>&#8220;What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>Lily would no longer take his orders; and, because he
felt his wife escape him, it was he, Trampy, who now
became jealous. When, from a distance, among the tables,
he saw Lily ride round the stage and all those heads
raised toward her, those opera-glasses pointed at her,
he followed her with an anxious eye. &#8220;Miss Lily!&#8221;
&#8220;Miss Lily&#8221; was his wife, after all! Those rounded arms,
that lissom figure, those twinkling legs were all his, every
bit of them! He was the husband, by Jove! It was not
a marriage for fun, as with Ave Maria: it was a marriage
for good and all, which had cost him two pounds&mdash;&#8220;Yes,
siree!&#8221;&mdash;at the Kennington registry-office. And it
wasn&#8217;t only her flightiness, her smiles at the front boxes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
but &#8220;<i>my</i> work, <i>my</i> salary, <i>mine</i>&#8221; into the bargain! She
was acting like a bad wife, forgetting her most sacred
duties!</p>
<p>Lily stood on no ceremony with him, took her title of
&#8220;Miss&#8221; seriously: very flattering for him, very flattering,
he must say! He no longer knew himself: he who, in the
old days, used to answer: &#8220;My lord, rely on me!&#8221; when
a half-tipsy swell invited him to come and drink champagne
with some stage-girls, now became furious if men
in the audience, not knowing who he was, sized up &#8220;Miss
Lily&#8221; before him&mdash;her shoulders, arms and the rest&mdash;with
reflections such as &#8220;I could do with a bit of that!&#8221;
or, &#8220;A nice little supper ...&#8221; He felt inclined to
shout in their faces that she was no &#8220;miss,&#8221; but his wife,
by Jove!</p>
<p>He became more and more jealous. The thought of
Jimmy, especially, kept running in his head. He felt a
twinge whenever he heard him mentioned. And Jimmy
was often mentioned just at present, for he was said to be
preparing a new turn, a turn which would make him famous,
unless it killed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If only it would!&#8221; Trampy hoped.</p>
<p>Jimmy was Trampy&#8217;s bugbear. He had flattered himself
that he had snatched Lily from Jimmy by sheer prowess;
and not a bit of it! The recollection of that drove
him mad, the sense of his powerlessness exasperated him,
he had but one idea left: to show Lily ... and
Jimmy ... the sort of man he was; to take his revenge.
That great scheme of his, that discovery that
would show what he was made of, the invention which
he had patented in America with Poland&#8217;s money&mdash;oh,
she had revenged herself finely, had that Parisienne!&mdash;well,
the time to apply himself to that trick had come.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
Lily had refused to do it. All right, he would do it himself!</p>
<p>But, if he was to succeed, it was necessary that Lily
should supply him with money, more money, lots of
money. The apparatus was incomplete and had probably
got damaged in the London warehouse; it would need repairs,
improvements. Now Lily seemed intractable. She
was vexed at having to earn money for two, pretended to
have none too much for herself; it was her costumes
now: six sets of tights, one for each evening, pink, green,
red, blue, gray, white and assorted ornaments, silk ribbons....</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t want to kill herself with work for nothing,
as she had been doing up to now:</p>
<p>&#8220;A lady isn&#8217;t a performing dog!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Trampy swallowed his bitterness when he heard that.
Lily was escaping him altogether. Sometimes, he would
go on the stage, sit down in a corner and, from there, see
Lily, a shawl over her shoulders, her throat wrapped in a
scarf, walk up and down, behind the back-drop, like a
passenger on the deck of a ship, at one time with a
monkey-faced, red-whiskered sketch-comedian; at others,
according to the chances of the week, with the female-impersonator,
the boy with the green eyes. There was no
harm in that: they were at home, among themselves, Lily
was no damned lalerperlooser, he wouldn&#8217;t have had her
so. And Trampy did not dare say anything, for fear of
being made a laughing stock and also lest he should offend
&#8220;Miss Lily.&#8221; But he was tormented with jealousy
nevertheless, merely at seeing her talk pleasantly with
her acquaintances. And yet it was innocent enough, a
mere &#8220;Hullo, Lily!&#8221; &#8220;Hullo, old boy!&#8221; by way of keeping
herself in touch with the news, for Lily hardly ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
looked into <i>The Era</i> or <i>Das Program</i>; all those names,
all that competition frightened her!</p>

THE BOY WITH THE GREEN EYES<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>She had learned nothing new about Pa, except that the
troupe still existed, but in quite a small way, of course.
Her Pa was in favor of soft treatment, now, so they said;
he had changed his manner. &#8220;Too late!&#8221; murmured Lily
thoughtfully; but she was much amused when she heard
that Tom, in addition to keeping up his trade as a shoeblack,
was learning boxing, with bulldog obstinacy, in
order to give Pa back his blow on the nose and beat him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
in a square fight. And didn&#8217;t some one say that Tom
was stage-struck, too? Tom, that dwarf, with his short
arms, on the stage! Crazy! every one of them!</p>
<p>And then they were always talking of Jimmy: Jimmy
here, Jimmy there. It was becoming serious, Lily
couldn&#8217;t get over it. She wondered what old Martello
would say if he heard that: Jimmy an artiste! Pooh!
Nonsense! And it was true, mind you! It was repeated
from mouth to mouth, his fame was spreading, his fame,
that is to say, in the bars, in the wings, among pros; you
heard his name mentioned together with a hundred
others; but that already was a great deal, that one could
say, Butt Snyders, Laurence, Jimmy, Marjutti, all mixed
up, as though he were their equal, he who had done nothing!
But he would &#8220;do,&#8221; it was in the air: some stroke
of luck, who could tell? And Lily knew him to be ambitious.
Lady or no lady, she was an artiste first and
foremost and hated competition. She had been whipped
for her rivals, Lillian, Edith and Polly, had caught it for
Laurence and for the fat freaks, too, and she depended on
her work for her bread. When she saw a new troupe
come to the front it made her anxious: even children
&#8220;that high,&#8221; who played bike in between the pillars of
the stage, she felt inclined to stamp upon; and if people
ever asked her advice, she did not hesitate to tell them
wrong. Men especially were disastrous competitors, even
the ignorant ones. You never knew where you were
with them, they dared do anything! She could not help
getting mad when she thought of it. One more to take
the bread out of her mouth! For it was all very well to
treat him as a simpleton, to talk of his crotchets&mdash;he had
views concerning a stage-apprentices&#8217; fund, a home of
rest for superannuated artistes and so on&mdash;Lily considered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
him dangerous. He was not a silly Glass-Eye or a stage-struck
Tom; he was an ambitious Jimmy. But all the
same, how absurd! A hypocrite like that was fit to write
to Pa and get a poor girl in trouble, but was not the man
to risk his skin! She laughed, not a stage smile, no, a
real laugh, head thrown back, full-throated. An artiste,
O Lord! Yes, like a heap of bluffers who were to do this
and that, all sorts of wonderful things! and who ended
by making a laughing stock of themselves, the whole
business was so childish, faked up with ropes and weights,
nursery-toys, Punch-and-Judy rubbish. It would be just
like that with Jimmy, sure: lots of noise and then ...
nothing! And he would have lost his place as manager
and he would starve, the josser: that would teach him
to be spiteful! And where was Jimmy? He might
be very clever, in his shed in London, swinging from his
rope, like a monkey on a string, but to do that before an
audience was different. There would be no Jimmy left!</p>
<p>She liked to talk to herself like that. Miss Lily avoided
thinking of a possible stroke of luck, she who had
taken such pains to attain so little, just to become Mrs.
Trampy, to have the honor of working for Trampy and
feeding Trampy. Oh, she was tired of it, did all she could
to find him work, to spur him on! She even wanted him
to practise. And she mentioned Tom and Jimmy to him,
all those beginners, all the others who were coming on.</p>
<p>&#8220;She thinks more of him than of me,&#8221; he said to himself.</p>
<p>And time passed and passed. It was now eight months
that they had been traveling through Germany: and then,
at last, came Berlin, the center of the agencies, like the
plunge into Chicago, after the Western Tour, or New
York, after the Eastern, or Paris, or London. Lily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
asked herself for what part of the world she would sign
contracts. She would have liked Australia, South Africa,
the States, so as to leave her husband in Europe,
sitting up on his hind-quarters, like a trained dog, waiting
for his &#8220;missis&#8221; to come back:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could have the Kolossal in the meantime,&#8221; Lily
thought. &#8220;A month there would do me nicely! I&#8217;d like to
beat the fat freaks in their own country and show Pa that
I don&#8217;t need his old troupe to star with!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily had some hope: an agent had given her to understand
that she would be engaged, without a doubt, at
that famous music-hall. But no! She learned that the
Kolossal was not wanting cyclists, it had an attraction for
next month, something sensational, it was said. And, in
fact, suddenly, in the space of a night, the walls of the
capital were covered with huge posters&mdash;&#8220;Bridging the
Abyss!&#8221;&mdash;at the Kolossal!</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Lily asked herself.</p>
<p>And she was thunderstruck when she learned that this
was Jimmy&#8217;s new trick! She had no doubt left when,
looking into a bookseller&#8217;s window, she saw Jimmy&#8217;s portrait
in <i>Die Illustrirte Zeitung</i>, the popular illustrated
paper in Berlin.</p>
<p>Her arms fell to her sides! What, she thought, already?
All this advertisement for that Jimmy? She had lost
the Kolossal because of him. Already Jimmy was taking
the bread out of her mouth! She could have wrung his
neck!</p>
<p>Never had the New Zealanders, or the Hauptmanns,
or the Pawnees, or any one, or anybody known such advertising
as that, except the great breakneck performers,
Laurence, the Loopers, the Motor Girl; and even then the
girl was packed up in her machine like a sausage. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
&#8220;Bridging the Abyss,&#8221; the papers said, required art:
everything depended on the exact impetus, the faultless
balance. The press was filled with clever puffs, biographies,
descriptions of the apparatus, the cool daring which
it needed to try that without a rope, to risk the performer&#8217;s
life six times in six seconds. London and Paris were
both said to have wanted the attraction; and Berlin was
to have it first; and <i>hoch</i> for the Kolossal!</p>
<p>Trampy also was flabbergasted, when he read about
this:</p>
<p>&#8220;But ... but ... but it&#8217;s my apparatus and
nothing else! Why, I patented it in America! Do you
understand now,&#8221; he asked, without, however, entering
into technical explanations, &#8220;do you understand now,
when I wanted you to help me? It wasn&#8217;t a question of
the rusty bike! You&#8217;ve made me miss fame and fortune!
And to think that I have an apparatus rotting away in
London, in a warehouse, and that, if you&#8217;d listened to me,
I should have been at the Kolossal now ... and
covering you with diamonds!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like your style!&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;You&#8217;d have made me
break my back in your stead! I know you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but I shan&#8217;t swallow that,&#8221; said Trampy, in his
exasperation. &#8220;We shall see! I have my rights. I shall
enforce them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make a fool of yourself,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;When a
thing has to be done, it gets done without all that talk:
look at Jimmy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang your Jimmy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a question of <i>my</i> Jimmy,&#8221; retorted Lily, &#8220;but
of <i>my</i> money. I should simply have flung it away! You,
do a thing like that! You risk your skin! Rot!&#8221;</p>
<p>Trampy, in his rage, would have boxed Lily&#8217;s ears, had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
it not been for her nails, which she held ready to scratch
his face, and he went out fuming. He ran off to the
agents, but there was nothing for him. And yet Trampy
knew or, at least, supposed that they must want an opposition
show to &#8220;Bridging the Abyss.&#8221; They must, surely!
Why, everywhere, in all the great centers, every music-hall
had its rival opposite or beside it: everywhere, each
establishment strove to inflict empty houses upon its rival
by offering more sensational or more breakneck tricks.
At the Kaiserin, the rival of the Kolossal, they were,
without a doubt, looking for something to set against
&#8220;Bridging the Abyss&#8221; and they had nothing, or else
Trampy would have known it: among pros such matters
were always known long beforehand. Oh, Trampy was
prepared to do anything to escape his wife&#8217;s sarcasm!</p>
<p>And, one evening, behold Trampy returning in triumph
to the café where Lily awaited him:</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I knew it wouldn&#8217;t go like
that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what?&#8221; asked Lily. &#8220;Have you got a number
thirty-seven? Thirty-eight? A fresh conquest? Something
quite out of the common?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Laugh away, Lily! That son of a gun shall hear me
talked about yet, by Jove! And everybody else will, too.
You must be prepared for anything, Lily, when you marry
an artiste!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s happened?&#8221; asked Lily, much surprised.</p>
<p>This had happened: the two music-halls had fought.
Jimmy, who was unable, it seemed, to get London or
Paris, had offered his &#8220;Bridging the Abyss&#8221; to the Kaiserin,
but his price was considered too high. From there
he went to the Kolossal and made the same proposal.
Now, times were hard for the music-halls, sucked dry by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
the enormous salaries that had to be paid. The managers
were standing shoulder to shoulder, in the presence of
the common enemy, the artiste and, more particularly, the
originator of sensations, who is indispensable and who
makes you an offer with a pistol at your head, like a
highwayman demanding your money or your life.</p>
<p>But a turn like that meant an assured success; and the
Kolossal offered Jimmy five hundred marks a night, so as
to spike the Kaiserin&#8217;s guns by getting hold of a unique
turn and one not easy to replace; a piece of underhand
work involving two months&#8217; empty houses at the Kaiserin,
which, as it was, had only a second-rate troupe by
way of &#8220;sisters,&#8221; while at the Kolossal they had Roofers
engaged by the year, real ones, the complete dozen,
words and music guaranteed. And now the Kolossal
would make huge money with &#8220;Bridging the Abyss&#8221; and
sink its rival; it was a master-stroke. But they knew
everything at the Kaiserin. The Kaiserin also wanted
a &#8220;Bridging the Abyss.&#8221; It would have one, a better
one, with a finer title: &#8220;Arching the Gulf!&#8221; And they
would get it for three hundred marks! And they must
be ready, quick, quick, before the Kolossal, and it was
just possible: they had twenty days yet; the apparatus
would be made; they knew the plans, the dimensions;
the house would be fixed up accordingly; they must succeed
at all costs and not let themselves be strangled without
defense! It was a struggle to the death! They
would fight with corpses, if need be! Other people had
broken their backs for them before now; there would
be no difficulty in finding one more to risk his life six
times in six seconds for three hundred marks a night.</p>
<p>And it was at that moment that Trampy offered himself.
They had heard his name:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Trampy Wheel-Pad, the tramp cyclist with the red-hot
stove?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me,&#8221; said Trampy.</p>
<p>And, full of self-assurance, he explained the object of
his visit:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the first to construct it; I patented it myself at
Washington; I will produce the documents!&#8221;</p>
<p>It will be understood why Trampy wore his air of conquest
when he returned home that day. He had his engagement
in his pocket! He displayed it victoriously to
Lily, passed it over her face, reveled in his revenge. At
last he was going to show Lily whether he was able to
keep a wife or not; and champagne suppers every evening,
by Jove, with girls&mdash;no damned lalerperloosers&mdash;just
to show her!</p>
<p>That same evening, he left for London, with an advance
from the management, and came back to Berlin
with the apparatus, the whole set up and repaired in a
week, a gang of men working night and day. Followed
practice with the rope, on a movable pulley, from early
dawn, like a man determined to accomplish his breakneck
feat, alive or dead; for Trampy would have done,
no matter what, for Lily to cease being &#8220;Miss&#8221; Lily, to
admit herself married and married for love and not to
escape whippings, to cease being ashamed of him, to
show herself proud of him, on the contrary, especially before
Jimmy!</p>
<p>Trampy, in his less enthusiastic moments, felt a certain
uneasiness: Jimmy&#8217;s proximity, his own patents far
away, in America. But he assumed a bold face, declared
himself the inventor, practised unrelentingly, with hatred
of his rival in his heart. This hatred seemed to increase
his powers of work. He practised, practised. He had a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
lively intelligence, if his heart was a trifle flabby. And he
was very skilful, besides, when he condescended to take
the trouble. He was a quick worker: in less than twenty
days everything was ready, and &#8220;Arching the Gulf&#8221;
sprawled over the hoardings of Berlin, side by side with
&#8220;Bridging the Abyss.&#8221; One saw nothing else; and the
Kaiserin opened its doors forty-eight hours before Jimmy.
It was a huge success. Trampy received an ovation
when, after the release of the terrible springs which
flung the bike from one pedestal to another, in five seconds
he fell on the mattresses outspread to receive him,
behind a cloth.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that Jimmy was present at the
show. He was smashed before he had even begun!
There, before his eyes, was his own invention worked by
another! He had expected competition, of course; it was
impossible, he knew, to discover anything that wasn&#8217;t
copied at once; snatchers of ideas, who prowl around
artistes, plagiarists, pirates, swarmed as thick as any
other sort of thieves. And, as ill luck would have it,
though his turn was difficult to perform, the apparatus,
at least, was simple to construct: four powerful springs,
screwed down with a jack, which the weight of the leaping
cyclist, as he fell upon each pedestal, released one
after the other, causing him to take enormous jumps
forward. It was an ideal breakneck machine, easy to carry
about; only the calculations had been difficult. They had
cost him a lot of trouble to establish; and now another
was profiting by them! Perhaps some one had patented
the invention before him! For he, too, before showing it
in public, had patented it in England and Germany; and
his anger knew no bounds, his energy was increased fourfold
when he learned the name of the plagiarist: Trampy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
again! Trampy, who had stolen his love, who had stolen
his Lily ... and who was now stealing his idea ...
robbing him of the fruit of his labor! Jimmy, in spite of
his fury, resolved to keep calm: the law first. He was
protected by the law, unless&mdash;and that was impossible&mdash;unless
Trampy had had the same idea as himself before
him and taken out his patents before the publication in
<i>Engineering</i>. Jimmy showed a prompt decision, a feverish
activity. First of all, he must put the law in motion,
bring an action against Trampy, telegraph to the patent
office at Washington to ascertain the date. Meanwhile, he
made his first appearance on the day fixed for it. His success
was even greater than Trampy&#8217;s; his leaps were
twice as wide, more in accordance with his courage.
The way in which he &#8220;bridged the abyss,&#8221; in the huge
hall where he gave his show, was enough to prove that
he was the inventor, the creator, the great, typical, daring
performer, who, disclaiming death, marches to glory and
fortune even as heroes, flag in hand, rush to the assault
under fire.</p>
<p>It was a bolt from the blue for the Kaiserin when the
little paper arrived, the injunction against &#8220;Arching the
Gulf.&#8221; A steamer caught in a cyclone would undergo
much the same disablement, under a sea sweeping her
from stem to stern, swamping the saloons, drowning the
very rats in the hold. Jimmy&#8217;s active inquiries had not
taken long: telegram followed upon telegram; the British
consul woke up. The law at Washington was formal
and precise: nothing could be patented that had been
known, or used, or published before the patent was
applied for. Now the article in <i>Engineering</i>, of course,
appeared prior to the step taken by Trampy. And in Germany,
also, Jimmy won his case; the court found in favor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
of the absolute novelty of the invention. The Kaiserin
could not give its performance short of paying five hundred
marks a night to its rival, the Kolossal. This meant
the wreck of &#8220;Arching the Gulf;&#8221; and Trampy came
down with it. For a few days, he led a terrible life, a
desperate struggle, made efforts in every direction; but,
at last, worried, hustled, driven to bay, Trampy disappeared
into the darkness, while Jimmy, freed from this
enervating opposition and feeling sure of himself henceforward,
gained fresh courage, added another arch to
&#8220;Bridging the Abyss.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was done, he had made his start, he had a name, he
was the man who draws crowds; he received brilliant
proposals from all sides, from the Western Trust, among
others. He felt himself somebody; and money also was
coming in. He could at last realize what he had in his
head ... in the absence of love there would be fame
... oh, something a thousand times more sensational
than &#8220;Bridging the Abyss,&#8221; more modern, more scientific,
something which he confided to nobody, which he kept
locked up in his brain, in his heart, like a love passion,
a thing which would be his alone, this time, which no one
could take from him! For it would not be a question of a
spring and a click, only. The thing moved in his breast,
lived in his brain. When he thought of it, his cheeks became
hollow with ambition, his eyes lit up. He seemed
to tower over immense perspectives; and, from that
height, Trampy appeared to him so small, so small, so
really small that he felt his anger decrease. And then
there was Lily! To send Trampy to his wife with a black
eye or a bloody nose, to turn the husband into an object
of ridicule to his wife, that was impossible for him; it
would have shown lack of respect for Lily, poor darling;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
he would not humiliate her in her man! She loved him,
perhaps, in the illusion of her seventeen years! Hurt
<i>her</i>? Never! Jimmy wiped the episode from the slate;
hard as it was, he forgave that highway robber, in the
name of his dead love.</p>
<p>Ah, if he could have seen Lily when Trampy was
driven to confess his discomfiture to her! He would
have been revenged offhand! Lily seethed with rage
against her husband, that footy rotter! What! Was that
his great scheme? Did he call that an idea? How often
had not Jimmy spoken to her about it! It was pinned
on the wall, it lay about in the Gresse Street workshop
for months. She remembered seeing the plans, the diagrams,
the drawings in the papers. Jimmy had explained
everything to her at the time when he was still a josser.
And Trampy had stolen it from him, stolen it, stolen it!
Oh, he would make her die of shame!</p>
<p>It was a terrible dispute, a real &#8220;playing humanity,&#8221;
with threats, clenched fists, broken crockery strewing the
floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;To humiliate me like that before Jimmy!&#8221; said Lily,
furious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop that about Jimmy!&#8221; snarled Trampy, green with
jealousy. &#8220;I won&#8217;t have you mention him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall mention him if I like! Jimmy is a son of a
gun! Very well! But he&#8217;s a man! He&#8217;s worth two of
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trampy strode up to her with his fist raised.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you touch me,&#8221; cried Lily, seizing the lamp, &#8220;if
you touch me, I&#8217;ll smash it over your head!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>When Trampy received the visit of the <i>Gerichtsdiener</i>,
with the bill of costs to pay&mdash;for the Kolossal sued the
Kaiserin for damages and the Kaiserin came down upon
Trampy&mdash;when Trampy learned that, he became a
limp rag. Already he saw himself dragged before the
courts, his whole past laid bare: two wives on his hands,
for all he knew; Lily crushing him with her scorn; Jimmy
triumphant.</p>
<p>Trampy had a moment of real despair. Lily preferred
him like that, humbled at her feet. She seemed to understand
her husband, a man spoiled by easy conquests,
a boozer, a rake, who had taken too much upon himself
when he wedded a wife. Trampy was certainly not made
for marriage: having a wife was a different thing from
having thirty-six girls. His heart, weakened with premature
enjoyment, was no longer made for real love.
All this he too now perceived; and, in spite of himself,
realizing his unworthiness, he felt overcome by an ever-increasing
jealousy.</p>
<p>Those were melancholy weeks in the small room. He
sat for hours brooding over his disgrace. Lily silently
turned this time of rest to account and mended her costumes,
sewed spangles on her bodices, beside the earthenware
stove, on which the stew was bubbling; and then
came the meal, on the table hastily cleared of the mass
of ribbons, thread and needles, to make room for the
plates. Trampy choked as he swallowed that dinner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
which he had not earned, sighed sadly for the good cheer
of his dreams, the champagne suppers with girls. He
gulped down his meagre fare in silence, he who had
known the gay junketings, the noisy laughter and the
&#8220;Roman nights!&#8221; To go from there and drown his sorrows
in the bar next door was but a step. And Trampy
had sorrows outside his recent defeat: sorrows which
were even more bitter. He felt that, this time, he was
losing Lily.</p>
<p>Lily was surrounded with sympathy. When she went
the round of the agencies, the pros courted her. They
looked upon Lily in the light of a wife tired of her husband.
They prowled round that possible prey. A Lily
was worth the having, meant an assured income for
whoever succeeded in winning her affections and managing
her properly: not with brutality, no, rather not;
home joys, like Mr. Fuchs! Who was destined one day
to own those full-blown seventeen years, those twinkling
legs, that lissom body, trained to spin round and round,
unerring and exact? What lucky dog would have her
for himself, would succeed in making her love him?
They pitied Lily openly, to disgust her with her husband
and hasten on the catastrophe. Trampy? He was no
husband for her! They, ah, yes, now that was a different
matter! And they talked of the dangers attendant upon
Trampy&#8217;s mode of life; the impersonator told her of the
terrible diseases brought on by constant tippling; they
exaggerated it all on purpose, amused themselves by
frightening her; until Lily, sometimes, would look upon
herself as a pretty little gazelle chained to a mangy bear.</p>
<p>Trampy suspected all this, having himself, in the old
days, in the time of his glory, been one of those who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
hovered round wives ready for divorce, helping them, if
need be. He could have smashed the face of that green-eyed
impersonator. There was also that architect, that
theater-builder, Harrasford&#8217;s friend: he was passing
through Berlin and Lily had taken his fancy the other
evening, at the café; he had patted her cheek gaily:</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you when you were &#8216;that high.&#8217; You used
to sit on my knee. How beautiful you&#8217;ve grown!&#8221;</p>
<p>There appeared to be an infinity of people who had
known Lily when she was &#8220;that high.&#8221; They paid her
more and more attention ... and then they believed
her to be looked after by Jimmy. That again was a
friendship dating back to her childhood, they said: Jimmy,
the bill-topper. He, too, had known her when she was
&#8220;that high.&#8221;</p>
<p>The greater part of this talk reached Trampy&#8217;s ears.
Oh, he could have killed that Jimmy! But he was obliged
to hold his tongue. Jimmy had him under his heel, with
that crushing lawsuit.</p>
<p>They did not even dare speak of it, so painful was the
subject. The little table by the earthenware stove separated
them like a wall; and there was one thing always
between them: Jimmy. Trampy never mentioned his
name now. He would have had too much to say....
And there were continual summonses, always; and lawyers,
always; and costs, always. Money melted away,
like butter in the sun. Lily was tired of it; and an agony
overcame her at the thought of leading a life like that
for the rest of her days:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;he&#8217;s taking the very bread from our
mouths, with his lawsuit! And I haven&#8217;t a decent hat
to wear.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll drive us to the workhouse,&#8221; grumbled Trampy,
staring before him, with folded arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your fault!&#8221; Lily began, but soon stopped: the
subject led to a surfeit of quarreling.</p>
<p>But, in her own mind:</p>
<p>&#8220;That son of a gun of a Jimmy!&#8221; she thought. &#8220;All
the same, who would ever have believed it of him? Can
he guess that all of this falls upon me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you were to go and see him,&#8221; said Trampy,
at his wits&#8217; end, one day when he had exhausted himself
in stormy explanations with the manager of the Kaiserin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I go and see Jimmy?&#8221; exclaimed Lily. &#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To try and arrange things,&#8221; replied Trampy, dropping
his head. &#8220;No one but you could ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll think about it, I&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said Lily.</p>
<p>But she had to get used by degrees to the idea of going
and seeing that Jimmy who was now ruining her. A
strange curiosity, nevertheless, drove her toward that
conqueror, once a bike-cleaning workman, who was now
topping the bill at Berlin and making as much money by
himself as a whole program put together. He would receive
her kindly, she was sure of that. Oh and then she
wanted to tell him that she had had nothing to do with
that business of the patents ... that she did not
approve of Trampy&#8217;s conduct ...! And then he
could give her news of Pa and Ma, as he had come from
London, where he must have seen them! And she was
dying to know! The idea was increasing with her that
life with Trampy had become impossible. And, in case
she should leave him, she dreaded finding herself alone.
Already there were all those offers being made to her,
a married woman, driving her mad! She, Lily Clifton,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
was treated like a &#8220;Parisienne&#8221;: she hated that sort!
To walk about the stage, two by two, might pass; but
it was possible to go too far, like the conductor of the
orchestra, who, the other day, tried to kiss her in her
dressing-room, married woman though she was! Then
what would it be when she traveled alone! On the continent,
too! Oh, she would have liked to be a good little
wife! But, as that could not be, better go back to her Pa
and Ma and have a home, a real one, with a servant in it.
She was yearning for a home. But how would she be received
in that case? Would they put the blame on her?
Had they forgiven her? Had she a Pa and Ma still?
That was what she wanted to know.</p>
<p>Lily would have liked to look handsome and elegant
on the day when she went to Jimmy, so as to show him
that he was not the only one who made a lot of money;
but she felt very small and terribly excited. The hotel
itself, the great clock, the waiters, everything made an
impression on her, so different from her boarding-house
in the Akerstrasse. She felt like running away after
knocking at his door; and Jimmy opened it with the preoccupied
air of a man who is disturbed at an inconvenient
moment. But suddenly he put out his hand in hearty
greeting:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Lily! Come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily entered a bright sitting-room, neatly furnished
with a sofa and comfortable chairs; no bed; a room which
served only for that. She at once felt more at her ease.
Jimmy motioned her to a seat near a table covered with
papers, full of marks and signs which she did not understand,
and books, rulers and compasses. She tried to be
simple and dignified; apologized for interrupting him:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Brain-work, I see,&#8221; she said, pointing to the papers.
&#8220;That&#8217;s hard, too, I suppose,&#8221; she added, to say something,
for a start, like talking about the weather.</p>
<p>&#8220;A matter of habit, like the bike,&#8221; said Jimmy, in a
tone of conviction. &#8220;Sit down, Lily, there in that big
arm-chair; you&#8217;re not disturbing me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;K you,&#8221; said Lily, sitting down, feeling reassured
by his cordial welcome and thinking that, at least, he was
polite.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you again, Lily,&#8221; Jimmy went on,
taking a chair himself. &#8220;Always glad to see you. And
how are you? Keeping well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;K you,&#8221; said Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad to hear it,&#8221; said Jimmy, scrutinizing Lily
with great kindness and trying not to see her preoccupied
expression. &#8220;I know what brings you here, Lily. You&#8217;re
a dear little thing, a kid, eh? A real kid at heart, aren&#8217;t
you? I bet you I guess. I&#8217;ve come from London. You
want to hear the latest news of your Pa and Ma, eh?
You&#8217;re not angry with them, I hope? Oh, it would be
wrong of you to be angry with them still! They&#8217;re very
fond of you, you know. They cried when you went away,
Lily. Your ... going away,&#8221; Jimmy insisted, with
a quaver in his voice, &#8220;was ... a great blow ...
to them ... too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do they get on without me?&#8221; asked Lily eagerly,
not wishing to break down and cry before Jimmy. &#8220;Poor
Pa! Yes, he was fond of me. He never let me fall on
purpose. He did not force me to work when I was ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Pa!&#8221; Jimmy broke in, glad of the chance to
give a fresh turn to the conversation. &#8220;Why, there&#8217;s no
harm in him! Your Pa&#8217;s an artiste in love with his
art, that&#8217;s all! I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the troupe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
made a hit yet. It&#8217;s had a success of a sort already&mdash;in
the small halls&mdash;at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells.
Your Pa just does without you as well as he can. He
runs after his pupils all day long, damn it!&#8221; said Jimmy,
with a laugh. &#8220;Your cousin stars.&#8221;</p>

COUSIN DAISY<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<i>Who</i> stars?&#8221; asked Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your cousin Daisy. She came as soon as you ...
as you went away and offered to take your place. Pa
Clifton sent her to the right-about, treated her like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
... like an I don&#8217;t know what, but she returned to
the charge. She&#8217;s doing very well now. She tries to be
like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Impossible!&#8221; exclaimed Lily. &#8220;What, that fat
freak?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your Pa will succeed,&#8221; Jimmy hastened to add.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll see. You ought to be proud of having a Pa like
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in a sense,&#8221; said Lily, who felt a certain satisfaction
at being the daughter of her Pa.</p>
<p>He was a bit harsh at times; but a man like her Pa, or
like Jimmy, was much better than her loafer of a tramp
cyclist!</p>
<p>&#8220;And ... Ma?&#8221; asked Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Ma,&#8221; said Jimmy, in a lower voice, &#8220;cried ...
oh, how she cried when she found that you had gone! No
doubt, she exaggerated any wrong she had done you. It
seems she fell upon her knees and prayed and asked for
forgiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgiveness? What for? Of whom?&#8221; Lily inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Jimmy, in a serious tone, &#8220;of whom do
you think people ask forgiveness, when they are alone,
on their knees?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Lily, greatly touched, &#8220;I understand! So
they didn&#8217;t put the blame on me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What blame?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For my marriage,&#8221; said Lily, lowering her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No ... if you had gone off to live with him
... oh, not you, not you, I know!&#8221; protested Jimmy,
seeing a gesture of Lily&#8217;s. &#8220;But marriage is different, I
suppose. You had the right, you were old enough to go
away with the man you loved.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>Jimmy turned pale as he said this; but Lily, hanging
her head and red with shame, did not notice it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;You&#8217;re blushing! Do you regret
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily did not reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; continued Jimmy slowly, &#8220;what they said&mdash;I
wouldn&#8217;t believe it, but you know they say a lot of
things&mdash;is it true?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded yes and raised her eyes to him with a sad,
weary smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t love you? And ... and ...
you, Lily,&#8221; asked Jimmy, taking her hand in his, &#8220;don&#8217;t
you love him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; said Lily, with such an accent of conviction
and such a look of disgust that Jimmy was, at one
and the same time, delighted to the bottom of his heart
and pained to the verge of tears.</p>
<p>Poor Lily! He now noticed her pallor, the dark rims
round her eyes, that exquisite face refined by inmost
grief. Lily, upon whom, since her visit to the shop in
Gresse Street, he had built his hopes of happiness! It
seemed to him like yesterday and already it was the distant
past. Was that what her rebellion, her bid for freedom
had ended in? Was that the crowning point of her
hard life? Lily, fashioned to be the companion of a loving
heart, was the prey of a footy rotter! Oh, if Jimmy
had not controlled himself, if he had not clenched his
teeth, for fear of talking! If he had listened to his anger,
let loose the storm that raged within him, shouted out
what he felt! But what would be the good of telling her
his love? Why add to Lily&#8217;s sorrows by letting her know
what might have been and thus cause trouble in her
household, when he wished for one thing only, Lily&#8217;s happiness?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
Suppose she did not love her husband: Trampy,
alas, unworthy though he was, remained her husband,
nevertheless! And there was no hope of breaking the
chain. The letters from Denver and Houston were anything
but encouraging. No proofs, no recollections of
Trampy&#8217;s marriage over there. So there seemed no way
out.</p>
<p>Nor did he wish to incense Trampy&#8217;s jealousy. Lily
would have had to bear the brunt of it ... as in the
old days, with Ma&#8217;s temper. Oh, there was no doubt
about it: Jimmy, to hold his tongue now, needed more
courage than when risking his life six times in six seconds!
But what was the use of fighting against fate?
Better submit, when there was no remedy, and strive for
peace!</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything gets straight sooner or later,&#8221; Jimmy went
on. &#8220;Many lives that once seemed spoiled have become
quite endurable. Time is the great healer. Trampy, no
doubt, will get over his faults. He will learn to appreciate
you. Have patience. Don&#8217;t exaggerate your bothers,
Lily. There are others unhappier than yourself.
You have a claim to happiness. You will know it yet.
Just think. You&#8217;re so young, you have all your life before
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The simpleton!&#8221; thought Lily. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy for him to
talk. But then ... why was he so jealous? Why
did he tell Pa about me? But for him, I should be at
home now!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was certain that, notwithstanding his kindly reception,
Jimmy now seemed to be taking Trampy&#8217;s part,
as formerly he had sided with Pa and Ma. And he was
lalerperlooser enough to ask Lily if her husband knew
that she had come to see him:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hope he knows, Lily. We must have no secrets:
did you tell him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He sent me,&#8221; she said, resolving to tell everything
frankly, since that was what she had come for and not,
after all, to talk about love ... money, only, and
business ... it was a question of bread and butter
to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! He did!&#8221; said Jimmy, a little surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Lily, &#8220;it&#8217;s about that lawsuit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak quite frankly, Lily. Tell me everything,&#8221; said
Jimmy, very calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Lily, yielding before his air of candor,
&#8220;Trampy is at the end of his tether; he has no money&#8221;&mdash;she
colored up to the eyes&mdash;&#8220;no money, no work; the
law-costs ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And whose fault is that?&#8221; interrupted Jimmy, rising
and picking up a cigarette, so as to have something to
fumble at with his fingers. &#8220;Whose fault is it, Lily, if
not that ... well, if not Trampy&#8217;s? Isn&#8217;t it fair
that he should pay for it? It would really become too
easy, else, to steal other people&#8217;s ideas! You know quite
well, Lily&mdash;you saw it at my place, on the wall&mdash;is it my
invention or is it not? And here comes Trampy,&#8221; he continued,
crunching up his cigarette with a nervous gesture,
&#8220;and patents it ... as if it were his own. It&#8217;s a bit
too much, you know!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy,&#8221; cried Lily, starting up from her chair, &#8220;I
swear to you that I had nothing to do with it! If I had
known, Jimmy, I would have stopped it! I call it stealing,
as you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m quite sure of that, Lily! I never thought it
was you! Calm yourself; sit down, do,&#8221; said Jimmy,
relieved at the sight of Lily&#8217;s indignation, as she stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
before him with blazing eyes and her face crimson with
shame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Important tricks like that!&#8221; went on Lily, sitting
down again. &#8220;No, those have no right to be copied. It&#8217;s
brain-work. You designed it yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but about the present,&#8221; said Jimmy, with a serious
air. &#8220;I can&#8217;t give in to Trampy. I&#8217;m bound to defend
myself. You came to see me about my action,
Lily. I can&#8217;t say anything on the subject. It&#8217;s ...
Trampy&#8217;s business, I suppose! Why, what would you do
in my place, Lily?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should do as you&#8217;re doing, Jimmy, you&#8217;re perfectly
right,&#8221; said Lily, very low, without raising her head.
&#8220;But couldn&#8217;t one come to terms ... avoid a lawsuit
... and not waste all that money on jossers?
What do you gain by it yourself? We can&#8217;t pay up,
Jimmy: those costs are breaking us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;us&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trampy isn&#8217;t working,&#8221; continued Lily. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t
done anything for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But then,&#8221; asked Jimmy, stopping in front of her,
&#8220;how does he live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ... I&#8217;m earning money,&#8221; explained Lily,
blushing, ashamed to own her distress.</p>
<p>Oh, it was hard for her, Lily Clifton, to have no money
and to confess it to Jimmy, that josser, who was making
his five hundred marks a day! Jimmy saw her before
him, huddled in her chair ... her faded hat, her
mean gown. He took in everything at a glance. Poor
Lily, who used to dream of dresses, to be reduced to that!
Then he understood. Pity moved him at the sight of that
poor Lily. It was all very well for him to say, just now,
&#8220;Business is business,&#8221; and to ask, &#8220;What would you do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
in my place?&#8221; He knew what he would do. A lawsuit
was not a question of sentiment, everybody knew that;
but still, it was no longer between men....</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Lily,&#8221; he said, putting his hand kindly on her
shoulder, &#8220;if all this is to fall upon you, we must see how
we can arrange matters. Sorry you didn&#8217;t come sooner;
I don&#8217;t want to add to your burdens, Lily, heaven knows
I don&#8217;t! I never thought of that. I ought to have suspected,
perhaps. However, I will withdraw the case.
I&#8217;ll manage. And the costs ... well, I&#8217;ll pay them
myself, if necessary, for you, Lily, for you; because I
knew you when you were &#8216;that high&#8217; ... no, not
quite so small; how old were you? Thirteen ...
and such a little thing, such a dear little wee thing. Do
you remember when I made night and day in your cabin,
by just touching my levers? And then it seems to me that
I always knew you: in Mexico, in India, in South Africa,
at the time of the elephants and the tiny birds. And then
later, that other Lily, the London one: the one of only a
few months ago. The one for whom ...&#8221; continued
Jimmy, in a voice smothered with emotion. &#8220;The Lily of
Rathbone Place. The Lily of Gresse Street. That little
toque, which suited you so well and which you complained
of ... you poor little Lily!... You poor
silly little thing! There, go home now and make your
mind easy, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, Lily. None of your
troubles shall come from me. Besides, as they say, a bad
settlement is better than the best lawsuit. I&#8217;m doing it
for your sake. Well, is that all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how kind you are!&#8221; she said, raising her eyes to
him, with a tear in them. &#8220;Why, Jimmy, you&#8217;re not so
bad, after all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Jimmy, lighting a cigarette. &#8220;I&#8217;m no better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
than most, Lily, and no worse. Flesh and blood, like
the rest. And, besides, for you, Lily ... If ever you
need me, Lily, if I can be of any use to you ...&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;For me,&#8221; thought Lily, as she returned home, &#8220;for
me. Ah, if I had known! Ah, when I think that he,
too, wanted to marry me, what a fool I was!&#8221; she said,
with a sigh.</p>
<p>She still felt in her own palm the gentle, manly pressure
of Jimmy&#8217;s hand. She still heard the kind words
with which he had comforted her on the threshold. Goodness,
how happy she would have been with a man like
him! Her ill-will disappeared. He was no longer a
cur, that josser, but a gentleman, rather, a brother, a
friend.... And she was proud, also, that Jimmy,
who was so busy and making such a lot of money, had
promised to come and applaud her, one of these evenings,
at her theater, at Kleim&#8217;s Garden, before his own
turn at the Kolossal. Oh, wouldn&#8217;t she work hard that
night! She would do all her tricks! She was bent on
pleasing him. And how vulgar and common Trampy
appeared in comparison. However, there was no help
for it now; and Lily hastened home to bring him the
good news.... In any case, Trampy would be
grateful to her for what she had done for him. As a
matter of fact, it had cost her an effort to go and pay
this visit.</p>
<p>She happened to run up against Trampy coming out of
the bar, where, according to his custom, he had been
drowning his cares. He had a moment of delight on
learning the result of the visit, but, mad with jealousy,
at once adopted a lofty tone, so as not to have to thank
her:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I knew he would knuckle under!&#8221; he said, without
looking at Lily. &#8220;The braggart! He prefers a settlement,
eh? And quite right too! He knows he&#8217;s in the wrong.
He&#8217;s retreating, he&#8217;s afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of what?&#8221; asked Lily, bewildered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of me. He knows it won&#8217;t pay to try my
patience too far!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid? Jimmy?&#8221; said Lily, indignant at all that
foolery. &#8220;Do you think he&#8217;s done that because he&#8217;s
afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And for what other reason would he have given in so
soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did it to please me, he did it for <i>me</i>, damn it, for
<i>me</i>!&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;You&#8217;re rid of your lawsuit: you ought
to talk differently and thank me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why should he do it to please you? What is
there between you?&#8221; asked Trampy, looking her in the
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re drunk!&#8221; said Lily furiously, with her hand
ready to scratch.</p>
<p>&#8220;No scenes in the street!&#8221; said Trampy. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go
into this at home ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shan&#8217;t come in!&#8221; said Lily, abruptly turning
her back on him. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to the theater!&#8221;</p>
<p>She had nothing to do on the stage; only the idea of
being alone in the room with Trampy seemed intolerable
to her. At the least discussion, Lily felt it, she would
have thrown the lamp at his head, so great was her indignation
at his insolence!</p>
<p>She was boiling over with anger when she reached the
theater. There were people practising; it was the time
for it. Lily went up to her dressing-room, shifted things
in her trunk, anyhow, for something to do. The idea that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
her husband thought her capable of anything wrong made
her angry. Oh, to get a divorce, to part from him! As
this could not go on for ever, it might as well be done at
once; but it would be better if there were no fault on her
part. A divorce, yes; but with the honors on her side; a
divorce in her favor! Patience, the opportunity would
come! It ought to be quite easy, with the girls whom
Trampy beguiled, the love letters which he received, to
catch him in the act, cover him with ridicule, get the best
of him. Oh, if she only could! To be a poor little victim,
how touching! A dear little outraged wife!</p>
<p>&#8220;You fool, if I catch you!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Then another idea passed through her brain. Oh, if
it were true! She would have danced for joy! Trampy&#8217;s
marriage in America.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it true? Is it true? God above, grant that it be
true!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was possible. Already, a few days before, the Jim
Crows who hovered round her had talked about it, in
covert words, in the hope of making things worse. There
must be some truth in it. There was so much news going
from mouth to mouth: Lillian, Edith and Polly were
the rage in Chicago.... That poor boy-violinist:
at Budapest, the stuffed seat to his trousers had slipped
from its place and allowed the dog&#8217;s teeth to reach the
living flesh; he had had to spend a week in bed with poultices....
Harrasford was contemplating a theatrical
trust on the Continent, planning a model music-hall
in Paris.... There were Jimmy&#8217;s successes, his
ambitions.... Amid all this news, to which Lily
listened, sometimes absent-mindedly, sometimes with interest,
among these adventures dating from everywhere&mdash;names
which she greeted like old acquaintances, with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
little nod: &#8220;Denver? Yes, I know; a big flat stage.
Mexico? I remember!&#8221;&mdash;among all those tales, Lily
pricked her ears when she heard the name of Ave Maria
coupled with Trampy&#8217;s. She had a vague recollection of
Ave Maria&#8217;s flight, after her departure from Mexico;
was it with Trampy? Were they really married then?
Oh, if it were only true! God above, grant that it were
true!</p>
<p>Lily, haunted by this idea of a divorce which would set
her free, had rummaged in Trampy&#8217;s trunk, among his
programs and posters. It was full of letters, photographs
of girls in outrageous hats, in tucked-up skirts, in tights,
with inscriptions. All this dated back to before the marriage,
a collection of treasures which he had not had the
courage to destroy. She had hoped to find some proof,
some clue; but no, there was nothing serious in it. Lily
did not give up, for all that; on the contrary. After the
visit to Jimmy, which made Trampy so meanly jealous,
she lost no opportunity of inquiring. But Martello himself,
the father, never had news of his daughter. He
hadn&#8217;t heard for ever so long; and it was to no avail that
Lily asked about Ave Maria, the one who ran away with
a man, a great artiste; she always received the same reply:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ave Maria? Don&#8217;t know the name. Ave Maria?
Haven&#8217;t seen her since ...&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jimmy, always; Jimmy here, Jimmy there; they
talked about him all the time: his ideas; something new
he had invented; something no one had ever seen: much
cleverer than &#8220;Bridging the Abyss,&#8221; it seemed; but nobody
knew what.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know!&#8221; said Lily, with a well-informed air and
very proud of knowing Jimmy and of letting people
think ...
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know Jimmy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since I was that high,&#8221; answered Lily. &#8220;He
used to hold me on his knees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is his new trick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not allowed to tell. He asked me not to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everybody praised her for her discretion. The sympathy
with which she was surrounded increased.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy,&#8221; they hinted. &#8220;Now there&#8217;s a fellow you
ought to have married, instead of your ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word against my husband,&#8221; she said, like a good
and devoted little wife. &#8220;I won&#8217;t have him insulted.&#8221;</p>
<p>That did not prevent her from laughing with her
friends. She felt a need of forgetting, or she would have
died of boredom, with a husband like that. She was
heavy at heart, sometimes. She was a woman, not an
icicle. She felt herself made for love. She was flesh
and blood, like Jimmy. She would have liked some one
to console her, to talk softly to her, as Glass-Eye Maud
used to do. There were plenty willing to play the part
of Glass-Eye Maud, no doubt: the female-impersonator,
for instance, with the green eyes. Oh, she would have
liked to be hugged, kissed full on the mouth, or else
stroked and petted gently! No home, no happiness; marriage
without love; that was her life henceforth. These
stage friendships were a relief.</p>
<p>The Bambinis romped with her. She loved their
gaiety, liked to touch their sturdy little limbs. That
evening, Lily, who was ready for her performance early,
was having fun with them. Dressed in her pink tights,
she looked like a blithe nymph playing with rollicking
cupids.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a charming group!&#8221; said a voice behind her.
&#8220;If I were a painter, Lily, I would do you like that!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>It was Jimmy, who had come to see her on the stage, as
he had promised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I spoiling your game?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It&#8217;s so pretty!
It makes me want to kiss the lot of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, booby!&#8221; said Lily, all excited and laughing.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you? You daren&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I daren&#8217;t! I&#8217;ll show you whether I dare ...
and ... I&#8217;m stronger than I look!&#8221;</p>
<p>And thereupon he caught hold of Lily and lifted her
like a feather&mdash;Lily, all taken aback, had not time to say
&#8220;Oof!&#8221; so great was her surprise&mdash;and Jimmy crossed
the whole stage with Lily in his arms, shouting to the
manager:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look what a dear little baby I&#8217;ve found! Isn&#8217;t she
sweet, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, in the wings, he gave her a good big kiss
on the cheek before putting her down.</p>
<p>The people around them laughed, applauded that stage
joke:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy, her old friend,&#8221; they said, &#8220;knew her when
she was that high.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily was very proud of it. And, a few minutes after,
when he had left her to take a seat in front, Lily jumped
into the saddle and rode round and round, without a hitch,
smiling to the audience, smiling to Jimmy in a front box,
Jimmy to whom she was grateful for coming to see her:
a famous bill-topper putting himself out for her ...
before everybody! She was faultless that evening, did a
dozen twirls on the back-wheel, made a record, was grand.</p>
<p>Trampy, meanwhile, was waiting for Lily outside, in
the passage leading to the stage-door. He had not seen
Jimmy kiss Lily, but he saw him carry her across the
stage, just as he was coming on himself, so he had turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
and hurried out to avoid scandal ... giving
way to his wife, who worked while he did not. He
had gone out at once, time to run to the bar and drown
two or three sorrows, and he was waiting for her now,
without paying any attention to the girls passing. As
soon as he saw Lily, he seized her by the arm:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough of this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I saw you, you
and your Jimmy! You can&#8217;t deny it this time!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Trampy, don&#8217;t insult me like that!&#8221; protested
Lily. &#8220;Why do you always say &#8216;my&#8217; Jimmy? One can
have a laugh and a joke on the stage without meaning
wrong, you know one can. Besides, if you didn&#8217;t like to
see him carry me in his arms, you ought to have smashed
his face, without so much talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to make a fuss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were afraid to. You&#8217;re afraid of him, that&#8217;s
what you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop jeering at me!&#8221; said Trampy, shaking her violently.
&#8220;You&#8217;re dragging me in the mud; it&#8217;s like those
whippings of yours! I&#8217;m tired of the affronts you put
upon me! You ought to have married your Jimmy and
left me in peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say,&#8221; sneered Lily, &#8220;that I remember running
after you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That Jimmy!&#8221; repeated Trampy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll kill that fellow
like a dog! If I don&#8217;t do it now, I will later, in a year, in
a hundred years, if necessary. I&#8217;ll kill him like a dog!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily gave a little laugh as she went out, followed by
Trampy. She did not wish, in that lobby, before the
people passing, to look like a woman insulted by her husband.
She laughed bravely, as she used to, on the stage,
with Ma, in the days of the great smackings. To see her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
laugh, one would have thought that Trampy was telling
her a story; and he repeated:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill him like a dog, like a dog!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Lily, who knew Trampy. &#8220;You talk too
much to act.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall see. Where&#8217;s your Jimmy hiding?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be nicely caught, if you met him,&#8221; said Lily,
who had just noticed Jimmy leaving the music-hall to go
to the Kolossal: &#8220;there he is, behind you.&#8221;...</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Don&#8217;t you try to get at me!&#8221; said
Trampy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, he&#8217;s behind you, damn it! Turn round and
you&#8217;ll see ... if you have eyes to see with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trampy turned round, half-reluctantly: he didn&#8217;t like
those jokes, but he didn&#8217;t wish to seem afraid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where? Where do you see Jimmy?&#8221; he grumbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, in front of you,&#8221; insisted Lily, pointing with
her finger and pushing him by the shoulder. &#8220;Off you
go!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no drawing back. He marched straight up
to Jimmy, who did not even recognize him and who
stopped politely. But Trampy had time for reflection, no
doubt: a clearer perception of professional brotherhood.
Better, after all, to remain friends ... among artistes.
And, when he stood before him:</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m, h&#8217;m. Have you got a light about you, Jimmy?
Give us a match,&#8221; said Trampy, taking a cigar from his
pocket.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>It stifled Lily, for the moment. She would rather have
received twenty &#8220;contracts&#8221; with the steel buckle than
see that cowardice in her husband. She had her Pa&#8217;s
blood in her, damn it!</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; she thought. &#8220;He believes me to misconduct
myself with Jimmy, and he is too much of a coward to
object!&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was nothing to be done. Trampy was as
incapable of anger as of love. All those years of a low
life had degraded him to that point. And Trampy had
even lost the right to bear Jimmy a grudge, made as
though he had forgotten everything, said that, after all,
it was much better to be friends. And all this under Lily&#8217;s
critical eye!</p>
<p>Jimmy! To be obliged to look pleasant at Jimmy!
It gave him a lump in his throat. Fortunately, he had
the others, the crowd of assiduous pros who thronged
round his wife. Against those he gave free scope to his
jealousy, and showed himself as strict with the rest as
he had been accommodating with Jimmy. He meant to
keep an eye on his wife:</p>
<p>&#8220;A married woman, on the stage, alone! I won&#8217;t have
any more of that!&#8221;</p>
<p>He hit upon a contrivance to be always with her: he
would be her &#8220;comic.&#8221; It was a new system which had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
come into fashion: the most plastic performances spoiled
by the juxtaposition of their caricatures; acrobats, Olympian
gods, parodied by a merry-andrew in a ridiculous
coat: just as though Nunkie Fuchs, for instance, had
taken it into his head to appear with his Three Graces and
mimic their tricks, kicking about at the end of a wire with
his fat, fatherly paunch and his round, silly face.</p>
<p>And Trampy, riding behind Lily, would simply give a
parody of her tricks; it meant little work to him and was
as good a way as another of going on the stage with
her and establishing his title to <i>her</i> work and <i>her</i> salary....</p>
<p>And off they went again, with the basket trunk, and the
bikes; and on the stage, every night, Lily, looking like a
goddess, and Trampy, dressed in rags, went through their
tricks and smiled ... applause for her, always; none
for him, ever. Lily wore a very sad look in consequence,
when they returned to the wings: a poor little wife, so
sorry for her husband; but she triumphed at the bottom
of her heart, while Trampy turned green with spite. He
was furious with Lily: tried to make her fall, pushed her
in turning; but Lily was too clever and sat as firmly on
her bike as Ave Maria walked her slack-wire, when the
brother used to shake it on purpose, whip in hand and
snarling as if to bite.</p>
<p>Oh, if Lily had not made efforts to be a good little wife!
Trampy was becoming unbearable. She posed as the poor
little thing, despised, deceived and betrayed by her husband;
she loved to hear people tell her so, called them to
witness and continued, but without result, to make inquiries
about Ave Maria.</p>
<p>And there were everlasting scenes at home. Lily had
enough of it, more than enough of it! She had even decided
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
to go away, to return to London; but, worn out
with worry, she had to take to her bed, with a high fever.
It was the finishing stroke: no work,&mdash;all the savings
gone....</p>
<p>Trampy, fortunately, found an engagement:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, the neighbors will look after you,&#8221; he
said, as he took his leave. &#8220;A man&#8217;s duty is to see that
his wife doesn&#8217;t starve, eh, darling? I&#8217;m going to make
money, too, and I&#8217;ll bring you heaps when I come back;
and I&#8217;ll send you some. That&#8217;s the sort of man I am.
I don&#8217;t talk of &#8216;<i>my</i> money!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Lily was left alone in Berlin.</p>
<p>Generally, she hated the hotels frequented by artistes,
but she was very glad to be in one this time. She, poor
little broken-down thing, was not left to the care of a
common servant; she had nice, kind nurses.... And
she had no lack of friends who took interest in her,
very sincerely, for that matter, for she was a favorite
with all of them, that pretty Miss Lily, who would soon
be free....</p>
<p>Lily let herself be coddled. Pending the arrival of
the money which Trampy was to send, she wanted for
nothing, especially in the way of luxuries: chocolates,
sweets, flowers, they brought her everything. Her
friends passing through Berlin, the impersonator, the
Paras, many others, hearing that she was ill, came to see
her, treated her as a lady, cried out how well she was
looking, how pretty she was and how it suited her to be
ill in bed.</p>
<p>Lily thought that very nice, put on a languid air, like a
poor little jaded thing that had got out of gear:</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall die of overdoing it, I know I shall,&#8221; she said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been at the bike ever since I was that high&#8221;&mdash;raising
her hand twelve inches above the bed&mdash;&#8220;and my heart&#8217;s
worn out by the hard work. My knees, too. Sit down
there on the basket trunk. You at the foot of the bed.
Have a chocolate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she turned over in her sheets, which molded her
firm, plump shape, took a bag of sweets from the chair
beside her and offered it round. Poor little martyr, she
had been forbidden them by the doctor, because of a
cough.... But she took them all the same, merely
for the sake of taking them, with a graceful movement,
her bare arm outstretched, her wrist making a supple
curve, like a swan&#8217;s neck, as she dipped her pretty hand
into the bag.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>In addition to her regular friends, such as the impersonator
or the Paras, others, the people staying in the
hotel, would tap discreetly at the glass door between her
room and the passage, come in on tip-toe, speak in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense!&#8221; Lily would say. &#8220;I&#8217;m not dead yet,
you know!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she laughed, and &#8220;Ugh! Ugh!&#8221; a cough or so,
a matter of lifting her embroidered handkerchief to her
mouth, a favorite gesture. And there were stories from
all parts, the cackle of the profession. The Paras were
living together now, as they explained to her. The parrots?
No go; given them up; one had its neck wrung by
a monkey in Chicago; another died of consumption at
Stockholm; the rest of the troupe sold to the stage-doorkeepers
of the different variety-theaters. His sight was
beginning to fail. She wanted smartness; wasn&#8217;t&mdash;how
should he put it? The husband looked for a word&mdash;wasn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
&#8220;Tottie&#8221; enough. However, they managed somehow,
as &#8220;eccentric duetists.&#8221; Lily thought that very nice,
those two talents combined, very original; but could they
give her any news of Ave Maria ... a great artiste ... on
the wire?...</p>
<p>If ever Lily might have hoped to receive news of Ave
Maria, it was during this illness, from the artistes who
visited her, on their way from anywhere to God knows
where. Lily had news of everybody: of Mirzah, the white
elephant, who had to be pole-axed for killing his keeper;
of Captain North&#8217;s seals; of the Three Graces, who were
doing triumphantly in England; of Poland, the Parisienne,
now starring at Bill and Boom&#8217;s. Tom was talked
about: biceps like thighs, now: a hornpipe danced on
the hands. She had news of the Pawnees, of the
Hauptmanns. Roofer was sending out four new troupes,
to Canada, Australia, India, Cape Colony: the Greater-England
Girls. She had news of the New Zealanders
and of her cousin Daisy, who seemed to find the star
business jolly hard work:</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind-bag!&#8221; said Lily.</p>
<p>They talked of Jimmy, of dogs, cats and monkeys and
of Tom Grave and Butt Snyders, those great breakneck
acrobats: they talked of one and all, but not a word of
Ave Maria. They knew her by reputation, as one who
had been through the mill, more than Lily had, as Lily
modestly admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darling,&#8221; said the impersonator affectionately, &#8220;don&#8217;t
bother about that Ave Maria of yours. I&#8217;m jealous. Be
mine, darling! How well we two should get on together,
eh, Lily?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands off!&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;Be good ... there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
... like that ... down by your sides ...
or you&#8217;ll get a smacking!&#8221;</p>
<p>Concerts were got up for Lily&#8217;s amusement. Sketch-comedians
pulled their faces: a musician twanged
his banjo. At other times, by closing her eyes, Lily
could have imagined herself in an aviary: the Whistling
Wonder imitated the nightingale, the thrush, the
lark. Another, an equilibrist, showed her how, when
he was obliged to stay in bed with a broken leg and had
nobody to wait on him, he used to wait on himself by
going round the room on his hands ... like that.
Lily was given, for nothing, a performance which was
worth a whole music-hall program. To put everybody at
their ease, Lily told them to smoke, took a puff or two at
a cigarette herself&mdash;&#8220;Ugh! Ugh!&#8221;&mdash;almost choked....</p>
<p>They amused themselves, among themselves, free from
any constraint due to the presence of jossers. Lily joked
with them as she used to do with the apprentices in the
mornings, when they showed one another their bruises of
the day before. She made them look at her pigeon&#8217;s egg,
on the side of her foot, the little ball-shaped muscle special
to her profession, like the triceps of the pugilist or
the dancing-girls&#8217; calves. She was vain enough to put on
a silk stocking, poked out her foot from under the bedclothes,
let them feel &#8220;her egg,&#8221; made it jump under their
fingers by a sudden contraction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all you&#8217;ve got to show us, darling?&#8221; asked the
impersonator.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want much, I <i>don&#8217;t</i> think!&#8221; said Lily, pulling
back her foot under the quilt.</p>
<p>The incident was interrupted by new-comers who had
also known Lily when she was that high. They brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
fresh news from Lisle Street. They had had a drink with
P. T. Clifton himself, had had a drink with an author who
was writing a book on the business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another josser who&#8217;s sure to talk a lot of nonsense!&#8221;
cried Lily. &#8220;If only they told the truth and described
us as we are, a sight better than the society ladies, who
come and wait for pros outside the stage-door!&#8221;</p>
<p>And they went on. The healths they had drunk with
this girl and that girl; and new turns: competitors who
were cropping up ... names ... names ...
Ave Maria? Dead, they said: somewhere in Ecuador or
Peru.</p>
<p>Then Lily stretched herself to her full length in the
sheets, feeling weary, weary, crushed under all that talk.</p>
<p>And Trampy just didn&#8217;t write, sent no money at all.
She blushed for him ... in spite of her wish to
catch him tripping, before witnesses. She was ashamed
to be his wife, his only wife, his little wife for ever.</p>
<p>On that day, as it happened, Jimmy came to pay her
a visit. His engagement at the Kolossal was ending.
He was to perform at the London Hippodrome, before
going to the States. A certain air of respect surrounded
him from the moment he entered the room, that Jimmy
who already stood higher than any of them among
the famous bill-toppers! And they gradually retired,
as though Lily would prefer that. It was no use her
saying, &#8220;Do stay!&#8221; They went all the same; and Lily
was left alone with him, a little embarrassed and yet
flattered at being thought on such good terms with
Jimmy. As for him, he had just heard about Lily&#8217;s illness,
Trampy&#8217;s absence, and hurried to see her, bringing
her the good news that the lawsuit was over. Trampy
would have nothing more to pay....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>From that day, Jimmy was sometimes seen at Lily&#8217;s.
He spoke little, sat down on the basket trunk, listened,
thought of things. He was known to have his mind
full of an invention superior to &#8220;Bridging the Abyss,&#8221;
one could expect anything from him: a wonderful chap
Jimmy, a bit cracked, though, with ideas of his own
which went the round of the profession and were
variously appreciated. A fund for stage-children; a
reserve upon their earnings, to be banked and kept untouched
till they came of age; a home of rest for the old
and the sick; a weekly matinée for the benefit of the
fund....</p>
<p>Jimmy described the piteous lot of those who grow old
in a profession intended for youth: but a few shillings a
month paid into the fund, a benefit performance or two
... and our home is established and endowed and
we should see no more stars flung aside, to die in hopeless
poverty, after amusing crowds of people for years
and years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you,&#8221; said Lily, laughing. &#8220;Put me down
for a pension for my old age ... if ever I reach old
age ... ugh, ugh!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she coughed, with the embroidered handkerchief
at her lips.</p>
<p>But Lily&#8217;s joke was left unechoed: everybody talked
professional shop, quoted figures; the habit of signing contracts,
of avoiding the traps laid by the agents had given
them all a keen sense of business. And the frequent traveling,
in the absence of education, had made them sharp
at understanding, quick in the uptake. Their clean-shaven
faces fell into wise folds, like lawyers&#8217;.</p>
<p>Jimmy also explained his idea about the apprentices,
the compulsory so much per cent., the inalienable deposit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
paid in by the Pas and Mas ... and, much more
still, by the profs and managers....</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;I&#8217;m with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a general laugh. The Whistling Wonder
interrupted the conversation by quacking like a duck at
Jimmy and cooing like a pigeon at Lily. Jimmy got up
and said good-by, pleased to see Lily making daily
progress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Lily,&#8221; they said again, when he had gone, &#8220;that&#8217;s
the one you ought to have married, not the other!&#8221;</p>
<p>And thereupon they began to pursue their favorite
theme and amuse themselves by describing the awful
troubles which she would get into one day with &#8220;the
other,&#8221; that drunkard;&mdash;the man with the thirty-six
girls! And they laughed and they laughed, my! Lily
herself held her sides with laughing.</p>
<p>All this was stage effect, professional exaggeration.
Lily dared not indulge in it before Jimmy. She was
more sincere, always a little embarrassed, in the presence
of that man toward whom everybody was driving her,
as though they all saw farther into her life than she herself
could. She was no longer ill, only tired, with an accumulation
of past wearinesses that made her love to lie
down flat. But she would get up to-morrow, instead of
remaining in bed to see her friends; no humbug before
Jimmy.</p>
<p>The next day when he came, Lily was alone. So much
the better, he had something to say to her. He had
made up his mind that day. His own present prosperity
formed too great a contrast with the poverty of Lily
... that poor kiddie who had run away from home
in pursuit of happiness and whom he now found here, in
this squalid room.... It was all very well to theorize
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
about children who have earned fortunes and who
haven&#8217;t a farthing; but that was mere talk! Suppose he
helped Lily a little in the meantime. He had prepared
all sorts of good reasons; he had found a smart excuse,
the great excuse of the music-hall, that he had been betting
on horses and losing. He would ask Lily to keep
his money for him, as a kindness, otherwise he simply
couldn&#8217;t help it, his money burned a hole in his pocket.
Then, on second thought, why all that fuss? Hadn&#8217;t he
known her since she was that high? And, the moment
he came in, he just handed Lily a thousand-mark note:</p>
<p>&#8220;For the law-costs, Lily! And, anything over, for
your expenses, till Trampy&#8217;s money comes. Only too
pleased to be of any use. You can pay it back when it
suits you. And good-by, Lily, ta-ta!&#8221;</p>
<p>And he hurried out, leaving Lily with the thousand
marks in her hand.</p>
<p>Lily was stupefied and confused. She asked herself
why? why? a real piece of brain-work, which made her
head ache. Anyhow she would give back the money
to-morrow! She wouldn&#8217;t keep it! Trampy would
be sure to bring some; it was impossible that he should
bring nothing; but, come what may, she would give
back the money to-morrow! She took the great oath
of the stage upon it: three fingers of her right hand uplifted;
her left hand on the lucky charm. And then she
went and shut the door, turned the key in the lock and
lay down....</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>A noise woke her: some one was knocking outside;
but, before she could get out of bed, one of the glass
panes of the door broke into fragments. Somebody had
smashed it with his elbow. A hand came through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
opening, turned back the key. The door opened and
Trampy entered, raging, growling:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a man here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t find him; you can kill me if you do!&#8221; cried
Lily.</p>
<p>She expected a terrible scene. Trampy, drunk, had the
look which he wore on his bad days. He peered into the
corners, turned a cunning eye on Lily.</p>
<p>Trampy had spent the evening at the café and there
heard of the visits which Lily received during his absence.
The neighbors he didn&#8217;t mind about, but Jimmy.
Jimmy again! The damned dog! Why should he poke
his nose in? And, perhaps, at heart, Trampy was not
sorry to have a scene with Lily, for he wasn&#8217;t bringing
home a pfennig, having spent all his money on champagne
with girls. He felt himself at fault. He would get
out of it with violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a man here!&#8221; repeated Trampy, walking up
to Lily like a madman.</p>
<p>She was humiliated to the core when she saw Trampy,
dazed with tobacco, heavy with beer, stoop and look under
the bed. And, suddenly, seeing the banknote which
Lily had laid on the table, Trampy shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t deny it this time. Tell me where the money
comes from!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from Jimmy,&#8221; said Lily, beside herself. &#8220;He
thinks of me, Jimmy does, while you leave me here to
starve. It&#8217;s ... it&#8217;s for the law-costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s another thing!&#8221; said Trampy, putting the
note in his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the money be!&#8221; cried Lily, leaping out of bed.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you touch it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything here belongs to me, I should think,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
Trampy, a little more calmly, already overcome with
drunken drowsiness. &#8220;Everything, even a dear little
wifie,&#8221; he continued, putting his snout under Lily&#8217;s disgusted
nose.</p>
<p>But she gave a movement of revulsion so spontaneous
that Trampy turned pale under the insult:</p>
<p>&#8220;W-what! N-no love?&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;I&#8217;m not used
to that. I can get l-l-love for the asking ... at the
ca-ca-café ... or the th-theater ... or anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Trampy, making a false step, caught hold of the
curtain and drew it back.</p>
<p>In the pitiless light of the morning, he appeared to Lily
like a drowned man, with a puffed-out face, swollen eyes
and wan cheeks. To think that she belonged to that! Lily
spat at him in contempt. Oh, rather sleep with lizards
and guinea-pigs than that; rather with a woolly dog, like
Poland, that Parisienne! Oh, to get rid of him and be
free again, thought Lily, never again to have Trampy
before her eyes! And, suddenly, her mind was made up.
She dressed herself hurriedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked Trampy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m off!&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough of this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said Trampy, dull-mouthed, flinging
his body across the bed. &#8220;What&#8217;s that? Say it again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say I hate the sight of you! I&#8217;m going back to my
Pa and Ma!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, you&#8217;re going back to ... well, good-by,
darling, goo-good ... goo-good-by,&#8221; stammered
Trampy, sprawling on the bed, among the disordered
clothes....</p>
<p>Lily moved freely round the room, without even troubling
about him, like one who has made up her mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
once and for all. She packed up her things in the basket
trunk. She put her bike outside the door; and, just as
she was going to look for a neighbor to help her down
with her trunk, an idea entered her head. She stopped
on the threshold, came back to Trampy, slipped her hand
into his pocket and gingerly took out the banknote:</p>
<p>&#8220;An insult like that!&#8221; she muttered. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather starve
than not give Jimmy back the money!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Lily!&#8221;</p>
<p>She thought she heard herself called, in her dream,
just because she was back in her room again, in London,
among familiar objects. She felt as if her life was going
on exactly as in the old days, as if nothing had happened
in between. Her marriage? A nightmare. And her
home-coming yesterday had been very nice: no questions
asked, no whys and hows. Her parents knew, of course.
They knew all about her troubles with Trampy. But no
reproaches, nothing: kisses, everybody very happy, including
herself. She snuggled under the bedclothes, in
the hollow left by Glass-Eye, who had gone down-stairs.
Lily felt sorry that she had left her trunk at the hotel,
when she thought of the cordial welcome she had received
at the hands of Pa and Ma.</p>
<p>It was quite three weeks since she left her husband.
She went over it all again in her head. Her departure
from Berlin! She meant to go straight to Jimmy, first,
and give him back that money; only, those Vienna hats,
displayed in the shop-windows, those dresses, those boots,
when she saw all that, Lily understood that she could not
return to London, to her parents, with dingy-looking
clothes, after her successes on the continent! Pa and Ma
would have laughed in her face.</p>
<p>Lily felt bound to say that she had been most reasonable:
three hundred marks for that Vienna dress, which
suited her so well; why, Jimmy himself would have approved.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see!&#8221;</p>
<p>She reckoned on her fingers: forty marks the hat,
three hundred the dress; and the underthings, chemises,
stays, a silk petticoat, boots ... that came to
... came to ... a week at a hotel in Berlin
... time lost at Hamburg ... the journey
from Hamburg to Rotterdam, Harwich and London
... the hotel on arriving, so as to be able to dress
before going home: it left her just fifty shillings to
play the lady with and buy presents for Pa and Ma.
And Jimmy ... Jimmy, who was in London also,
due to open at the Hippodrome! And she had sworn
that she would give him back that money at once! To
quiet her conscience, Lily, under her blankets, took the
&#8220;counter-oath&#8221; of the stage, with her left hand behind her
back, the fingers closed over the thumb, that she would
repay him the money, most certainly, as soon as she began
to earn any.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily! Can I come in, Lily?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Ma, bringing her breakfast and a paper, <i>The
Era</i>. Lily gave a quick glance round the room: her skirt
was hanging on the peg; the bodice lay, without a crease,
over the back of a chair, the hat on top of it, the linen
neatly folded: good! She did not look a scarecrow, at
any rate! And, sitting up against the pillows, with a
napkin on her knees, Lily breakfasted daintily, with her
finger-tips:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pa, Where&#8217;s Pa?&#8221; asked Lily. &#8220;Tell him to come up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Pa has gone out with the apprentices,&#8221; said Ma.
&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t wake you, you looked so tired last night.
Here, Lily, some more coffee? Another slice of bread
and butter?&#8221; continued Ma, spreading it for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;K you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>Lily accepted this as her due, like a lady accustomed
to the manners of good society, to having her breakfast
brought to her in bed by the maid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ma,&#8221; said Lily, as she sugared her coffee, &#8220;they
do understand things on the continent! They know how
to appreciate artistes there. I&#8217;ve had such successes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you were angry with us for teaching you your
profession,&#8221; said Ma. &#8220;You see now that it was for your
good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it depends on how it&#8217;s done,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;If I
had always been treated like this, I should never have left
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t bear your Pa and me a grudge, I
suppose,&#8221; said Ma, &#8220;or you wouldn&#8217;t have come back.
We knew you&#8217;d come back. This has always been your
address; your Pa never took your name out of <i>The Era</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t treat me fair,&#8221; said Lily, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve forgotten
most of it. Oh, don&#8217;t let&#8217;s talk about it any more!
Let&#8217;s talk of something else; let&#8217;s talk of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily knew all about their struggles, their successes;
had heard of it on the stage, in the cafés. But here, in
her room, as described by Ma, she put her finger on it, so
to speak, and realized more fully what a blank her flight
had made, what a catastrophe it had been for them.</p>
<p>And Ma gave details, tried to interest Lily in the fate
of the troupe; told her that, for months, the troupe had
been refused everywhere, because she wasn&#8217;t in it, and
her Pa had to change apprentices.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the troupe!&#8221; said Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the trouble your Pa took running after his own
fat freaks! I thought he would get heart-disease! And
months of it, without earning a thing. Oh, if your Pa
hadn&#8217;t had some money ...!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But he had plenty!&#8221; said Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not much, not so much as you think!&#8221; Ma hastened
to say, thinking she saw a spiteful allusion in Lily&#8217;s
remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, all right, I know,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;Never mind about
that. It&#8217;s my turn to make money now, for myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still that independent spirit! We haven&#8217;t got her
yet!&#8221; thought Ma.</p>
<p>And she went on talking of the troupe, of the cousin
who played the star.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;A nice sort of star!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not every one who can star in Berlin by herself,
like you,&#8221; said Ma. &#8220;Do you know, Lily, you ought to stay
with us: we should get on so well together. You would
manage the troupe; and, one day&mdash;who knows?&mdash;you
might make a nice marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am married, Ma! I didn&#8217;t live with him! Do
you mean to say you think ...? Not I!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re married, but you can get a divorce.
Jimmy used to make love to you; now there&#8217;s a man
who ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you used to say he was a drunkard, Ma!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; said Ma, rising to leave.</p>
<p>Lily was flattered, at heart, to be received like that.
She also felt proud that her Pa had not been ashamed of
her and that he had kept her name in <i>The Era</i>. Well,
they treated her as a lady, saw her value, gave her her
due. And she lay for a while enjoying her triumph, while
she turned the pages of <i>The Era</i> in an absent-minded
way: Miss This, Miss That, Cape Town, Calcutta ...
actors, singers ...</p>
<p>&#8220;Those aren&#8217;t artistes, any of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>Programs, plays, songs: &#8220;<i>Why I Love Women</i>!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know, you footy rotter!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Is Marriage a Failure</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think so!&#8221; thought Lily.</p>
<p>And articles, biographies ...</p>
<p>&#8220;Pack of lies!&#8221; thought Lily.</p>
<p>And pages of &#8220;Wanted ... Wanted ...&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily ran her eye down the columns: artistes&#8217; boarding-houses,
<i>costumiers</i>, scene-painters, dancing-schools, every
town, every theater. Hullo!&mdash;she had turned the page&mdash;Tom,
the dancer&mdash;Hullo! At Milan!</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo, Tom!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy at the Hippodrome next week; private address,
Whitcomb Mansions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh, he&#8217;s well off! What&#8217;s fifty pounds to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hullo! Miss Lily&mdash;Berlin&mdash;Permanent address,
Rathbone Place, London, W.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well done, Pa! Serve him right, the tramp cyclist!&#8221;
said Lily, throwing down the paper and jumping out of
bed.</p>
<p>Quite a business, her toilet. She was two hours titivating
herself. She wanted Pa and Ma to be proud of
her, of her successes on the continent. And, when the
apprentices came in from practice, you should have seen
her walk into the dining-room. A little air of simplicity,
her forehead put out for her delighted Pa to kiss, hands
all round&mdash;&#8220;Hullo, girls! Hullo, Daisy!&#8221; And she sat
down like a lady accustomed to smart restaurants, who
does not despise dinner at home, however, with a boiled
leg of mutton to recruit her inside after those champagne
suppers, those truffled pheasants, that damned continental
cooking! She accepted everything, and thought
it all very nice, simple life, simple joys, the only ones!</p>
<p>She set a good example to the new apprentices, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
eyed her stealthily, instead of eating, for Miss Lily&#8217;s presence
turned their heads entirely. My! A star like that, a
real one! Lily Clifton, the New Zealander on Wheels!
And dressed ... dressed like a lady in the front
boxes! Cousin Daisy was green with jealousy. Lily talked
of her travels, her successes and the crossing, gee! Waves
&#8220;miles high,&#8221; the boat standing on end! Glass Eye
Maud devoured her with her one eye, screwed up her
fat red cheeks in a fixed and motionless laugh, scared
before Lily, who came from over the sea, from countries
where savages live. Glass-Eye, in her perturbation,
served Lily first. Pa made no objection, asked Lily&#8217;s permission
to light his pipe: was she sure she didn&#8217;t mind
smoke? Lord, you never knew, with those ladies! He
swelled with pride. If it had been Christmas-time, he
would have ordered a pudding, my, a real wedding-cake
three feet across! His ideas of grandeur returned, his
triumphal tour round the world, the definite extermination
of the fat freaks ... if Lily remained
with him ...</p>
<p>After dinner, the apprentices retired, to finish sewing
some bloomers. Lily approved:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bloomers? Very nice ... for a troupe!&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently, in the afternoon, the three of them went for
a walk: Pa freshly shaven; Ma decked out in her jewelry:
Lily did not wear any, &#8220;only in the evening when
she went into society.&#8221; Tottenham Court Road, the Palace,
the Hippodrome.... Pa would have liked to
write up on his hat:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily has come back!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked to right and left, had the satisfaction of distributing
nods and bows to some artistes, with Lily on his
arm, as though to say:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You see it was wrong, all that people were saying,
about those smackings! And the proof is, here she is,&mdash;on
my arm, damn it!&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Lily, she thought only of showing herself:</p>
<p>&#8220;If Trampy could see me now!&#8221; she reflected. &#8220;And
Jimmy, if he could see me, in my fine dress, while it&#8217;s still
new!&#8221;</p>
<p>Regent Street reminded Lily of Pa&#8217;s generosity. She
would not be behindhand. Pa had to accept a red tie, a
pair of gloves, a match-box, as a present; Ma, an embroidered
handkerchief, a lucky charm. Lily had the satisfaction
of paying with gold and receiving change.</p>
<p>She was tired, in the evening, put on a languid air:
gee, her mother would have shaken her for less in the old
days! Lily put it on still more, to show them all that
times were changed. But she did the troupe the honor
of going to see their performance at the Castle. It was a
great success for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Made a bit, eh?&#8221; asked the manager, seeing her fine
dress. &#8220;Coming back for good, to star with the New
Zealanders?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; I shall see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily was quite ready to come back, in her own mind,
but she wanted to return in triumph. It all depended on
the price offered: to think that she had worked for them
at ten shillings a week, when she was worth quite two
pounds a night! She would see; she would make her own
conditions: for instance, herself in tights, the others in
bloomers ... a special tune for her entrance ...
no star beside herself!</p>
<p>Lily watched the New Zealanders&#8217; performance with
the air of an expert:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so bad; quite good ...&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>And she had various ideas: herself as a fine lady, undressing
on the stage. Or rather, no, as a statue, on a
pedestal in a park ... with Cousin Daisy at her feet,
throwing flowers to her. Then she would come to life, as
though waking from sleep, and step down prettily to a
special tune. Hullo, what&#8217;s this? A bike! And then, gee,
a blast of the trombone and she would show them what a
star was, a real one! Yes ... she would see ... if
Pa and Ma insisted ... perhaps ...</p>
<p>But her real triumph was next day, at practice.
Her Pa, excited by her presence, ran and ran, notwithstanding
his palpitations of the heart. It was no use his
trying to restrain himself: his enthusiasm mastered him as
soon as he saw them all in the saddle, his little Woolly-legs!</p>
<p>And no more Tom: he was all by himself now; and,
when he sat down to take breath, he still ordered his little
Woolly-legs about, shouted his cutting remarks at them.</p>
<p>Lily raised her head proudly. She seemed to take the
apprentices to witness. She had gone through that, much
worse than that, for years! She was a gentle little lady,
all the same. Besides, she was all for gentleness:</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave her to me, Pa; you&#8217;re making poor Cousin
Daisy quite nervous. She doesn&#8217;t know; I&#8217;ll show her!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, under her great waving feather, Lily, without
even taking off her gloves:</p>
<p>&#8220;There, put your foot there ... like that ...
and like that ... firmly. No, not like that!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, suddenly, stimulated with professional zeal:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, I&#8217;ll show you how it&#8217;s done!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, in an instant, to show them all how you&#8217;re got up
when you&#8217;re a star and when you come back from the
continent, Lily took off her bodice, pinned up her skirt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
amid the rustling of the silk and, bare-armed, in a lace-trimmed
chemisette:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, I&#8217;ll show you!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily, with all her little muscles alive, took a bike,
jumped on it as she would on a stool and then&mdash;yoop!&mdash;the
bike on its back-wheel, spinning round like a top.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twirls are as easy as anything: you only have to
know how to do them. Come on! Have a try!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the other, encouraged by a friendly slap, tried in
her turn and&mdash;yoop!&mdash;succeeded ... very nearly.</p>
<p>Pa was enraptured at the mere sight of Lily&#8217;s little
curled nostrils and her earnest look:</p>
<p>&#8220;What a professor she would make!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;If
ever she takes the belt, she&#8217;ll be simply grand. I can just
fold my arms!&#8221;</p>
<p>But he made her dress very quickly. That exhibition
of dainty underwear, which flattered his pride as a father,
would have driven girls used to sewing their own calico
shifts quite crazy: there would have been no holding
them; and, besides, artistes might come in at any moment.
It would not do for Lily to be seen half-dressed like that;
and she realized this herself, like a sensible little lady,
who hates scandal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay with us, Lily,&#8221; said her Pa, at home, after dinner,
when the apprentices had gone out. &#8220;Stay with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your duty,&#8221; said Ma.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you stay,&#8221; continued Pa, &#8220;I&#8217;ll make you a present
of a brand-new banjo!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, no more banjo for me,&#8221; said Lily, laughing.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve had my share.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, no more banjo,&#8221; agreed Pa, &#8220;provided you
stay with us: that&#8217;s all I ask. I shall be afraid of nobody
then; I&#8217;ll show them what an artiste is!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>And, warming to his subject, Pa built up his plans:
the great English tours; and Eastern and Western
America, Australia, South Africa:</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, Lily? Wouldn&#8217;t you like to see it all again? Or
else, for once, I&#8217;ll get up a troupe and take it round the
world myself, with you in it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Pa,&#8221; said Lily, very coldly, &#8220;I have business arrangements
of my own, more engagements than I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a business arrangement I&#8217;m proposing to you,&#8221;
said Pa.</p>
<p>&#8220;And shall I come on in tights?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In tights, if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And no other star but me!&#8221; continued Lily, explaining
her idea: undressing on the stage, or else the statue,
her own scenery ...</p>
<p>&#8220;Capital idea!&#8221; cried Pa.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then there&#8217;s the money side of the question,&#8221; said
Lily. &#8220;I make a lot of money now. I want to work for
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what you make with us, won&#8217;t it be yours, one
day?&#8221; suggested Ma.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay with us,&#8221; said Pa, &#8220;and Trampy will burst with
spite and you&#8217;ll be much happier here, with your Pa and
Ma, instead of with that good-for-nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or instead of remaining alone, which is even worse,&#8221;
Ma insisted. &#8220;You want us still, Lily ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you me! Let us talk business,&#8221; interrupted Lily,
who would have liked a pencil and paper, to make her calculations
with.</p>
<p>Ma, in her heart of hearts, did not think it at all nice of
a daughter to consider only her own interests; but Pa
hurried up, thought Lily was quite right ... although
he was greatly embarrassed in reality and asked himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
how much he could well offer her, so as to make a profit
for himself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he was relieved of his predicament by
Glass-Eye, who came in with a telegram for Miss Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it here!&#8221; said Lily, who noticed, as she opened
the envelope, that a chair had creaked and that the palm
of her left hand was itching: a sign of money. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet
it&#8217;s about an engagement. I have offers from every side;
you have no idea ... Well, I never!&#8221; she said. &#8220;A
telegram from Jimmy, at the Horse Shoe! I thought he
was at Whitcomb Mansions. What can he want with
me? He asks me to call on him! Funny way of treating a
lady. Why can&#8217;t he come himself?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Pa and Ma thought differently: Jimmy was &#8220;somebody,&#8221;
a man to be considered, right at the top of the
profession; she&#8217;d have done better to marry him and not
her Trampy Wheel-Pad!...</p>
<p>&#8220;You must go,&#8221; insisted Ma. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you like going
alone? Shall I come with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s different,&#8221; said Lily, who had a certain
pride and who felt sure that Jimmy would never mention
that thousand marks before a witness.</p>
<p>Her heart beat a little, as she went up the staircase of
the Horse Shoe to the third floor, on the left, door 32.
At first, she was surprised that he should be there, having
read in <i>The Era</i> ... but he might have moved. On
the whole, she was not sorry to show herself to Jimmy in
her pretty frock, he having seen her last in her room in
Berlin, looking ill, unkempt and frightfully ugly. She
was not sorry, either, that Ma was with her:</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in love, I suppose,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;Everybody makes
love to me: why do they, Ma? I&#8217;m not a bit pretty, off
the stage.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>And she took a mischievous pleasure in enlarging
upon her successes and her flirtations, there, on the staircase
of the Horse Shoe, with Ma beside her, and no
smackings, gee, nor any fear of smackings in the future!
What a change since her marriage!</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Lily went on, as she read the numbers on the
doors&mdash;29&mdash;&#8220;Ma, you ought to see the flowers I get, the
chocolates, the sweets&#8221;&mdash;31&mdash;&#8220;but all that does not prevent
a lady from keeping straight&#8221;&mdash;32&mdash;</p>
<p>Then she gave a stifled cry, her voice stuck in her
throat: Trampy, Trampy himself stood in the doorway,
his hands in his pockets, a cigar in his mouth, his hat
cocked over one ear; and he looked at her with a bantering
air:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to disappoint you, Miss Lily. You hoped to
find some one else, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma, utterly flabbergasted, had dropped on to a bench
in the passage, in the shadow. Trampy did not even see
her. Lily was crimson with shame at being caught tripping
by Trampy: she could not deny it. She wanted to
run away, but, stupefied with surprise, remained where
she stood, with dilated pupils, open-mouthed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can look at me till to-morrow morning and it
won&#8217;t help you,&#8221; said Trampy quietly, with the air of a
man who has prepared his speech. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got you this
time! I sent the telegram; I knew you&#8217;d come, wherever
he thought fit to meet you; you&#8217;d have come for less than
Jimmy; you&#8217;d have come for the impersonator or any
one else, never mind whom; any one in the rotten lot, any
gentleman in the front boxes, eh? It&#8217;s &#8216;Whistle and I&#8217;ll
come to you, my lad!&#8217; with you! But I thought Jimmy
would do best, Jimmy your lover, whom you followed
to London. Now my luck has brought me here, too ...
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
for my work ... not like you! And, by the way, Miss
Lily, have you brought me that thousand marks which you
got from Jimmy and which I was going to give back to
him, when you stole it out of my pocket? Or did you
spend it on the way here? You hadn&#8217;t a rag to your back,
when you left me, and I find you dressed up like a Tottie.
My compliments, Miss Lily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O God, strike him dead!&#8221; prayed Lily. &#8220;Strike him,
kill him, kill him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily felt like fainting. She could not breathe, her ribs
seemed to be crushing her lungs. At last she drew a long,
slow breath:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she stammered, overcome with shame, &#8220;well,
we can be divorced ... if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said Trampy, hardening his voice and throwing
away his cigar. &#8220;Go back to your Jimmy in the meantime.
You may be sure I have no use for a traitress like
you, an idler who refuses to work, a woman who lets
every man make love to her!&#8221; And, suddenly, pointing
to the stairs, &#8220;You can be sure that I&#8217;ve no further use for
you! Get out of this, damn you! And you&#8217;re not going,
mind you: I&#8217;m kicking you out!&#8221;</p>
<p>And therewith Trampy went back into his room and
slammed the door in her face.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clifton and Lily remained glued where they were.
At last, Ma, trembling all over, rose from the bench and
led away her daughter, who shook her fist at the door,
crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Liar!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you speak just now, my poor Lily?&#8221; said
Ma. &#8220;You ought to have answered back! So it&#8217;s true,
all that? A nice thing! You, who pretended....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let go, you&#8217;re crushing my sleeve!&#8221; retorted Lily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
angrily, pulling her arm away from the hand that
clasped it.</p>
<p>She went down the stairs, followed by Ma, without
knowing what she was doing. She would have liked to
find a train on the pavement, a motor, to jump into it, to
make off and never see anybody again, after the humiliation
which she had undergone before Ma.</p>
<p>She flung herself into the first cab that came along,
yelled a direction to the driver: Hyde Park, anywhere!
Ma found herself by Lily&#8217;s side, without being asked to
step in, and she repeated:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily, you ought to have ... Why did you let
him treat you like that? Is it true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all,&#8221; said Lily, suddenly turning and facing
her Ma; &#8220;first of all, it&#8217;s your fault ... yours
... all that&#8217;s happened, damn it! If you had been
less hard on me, I shouldn&#8217;t have gone off with that
footy rotter!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve often been sorry since,&#8221; said Ma. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been sorry
for it. Calm yourself, Lily. And then ... were we
so very wrong? Look how your husband has just treated
you before me, before your mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a liar! I swear it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Jimmy&#8217;s thousand marks? What was that money
for? Why didn&#8217;t you give it back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie! It&#8217;s a lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, who pretended you were making such a lot of
money!&#8221; continued Ma. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a word of truth in
what you said. You haven&#8217;t a penny. I can see it. Oh,
you&#8217;re the same as ever, my poor Lily&mdash;extravagant
habits, dresses&mdash;and here you are, penniless, left to yourself
with your expensive tastes. You&#8217;ll die in poverty
one day, without a Pa or Ma. Come back to us, Lily.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To make nothing? No, thank you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know! Ten shillings a week, eh? Family life,
as that old beast of a Fuchs says!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily,&#8221; said Ma severely, &#8220;don&#8217;t insult decent people!
Have some respect, at any rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Lily had no respect left for anybody. Pas, Mas,
Trampies, Nunkies, one and all, were so many slave-drivers!</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet it&#8217;s quite true, I&#8217;m penniless,&#8221; thought Lily
to herself. &#8220;I, who have earned a fortune for you!&#8221; she
grumbled under her breath, stifling a sob.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mad, my poor Lily! All that we have will be
yours some day. You never think of the future; you
spend your last penny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I earn and I spend!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And suppose you fell ill, my poor Lily?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hospitals aren&#8217;t made for dogs! Besides, I have
friends. And then, at least, I shall have had some fun
for my money, while you, if you died to-morrow, Pa
would marry another woman, who would spend all your
savings, all the money I have earned for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily,&#8221; cried Mrs. Clifton, &#8220;you&#8217;re insulting your father!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you things as they are; and I won&#8217;t come
back to you, because I can make more elsewhere! Every
one for himself!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t make a penny!&#8221; said Ma, gradually
getting angry. &#8220;You heard Trampy, just now. He called
you an idler. Your Pa, at least, used to make you work.
You&#8217;re trying to bluff us with those stories of your successes.
I dare say you&#8217;ll be glad, one day, of a crust of
bread with us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ma!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your contracts,&#8221; said Ma, &#8220;you&#8217;re always talking of
your contracts. I should like to see them and your programs
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show them to you: Munich,
Berlin, Hamburg. I&#8217;ve had successes everywhere,
engagements everywhere! I make more by myself than
all Pa&#8217;s troupe put together!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but how do you get your engagements?&#8221; said
Ma, pale with anger, seeing that Lily was escaping them
and, this time, for good. &#8220;Tell me how you get them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, through my talent, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your talent! Pooh! You&#8217;ve none left! You get
them through your friends: through your Jimmy, your
gentlemen friends....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You get them ... by looking pretty and getting
round the men ... you ... you ... you....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily drew back her shoulder, her arm stiff, ready to
strike; but a sense of respect withheld her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; she cried to the cabman, in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>And, without even waiting for the cab to pull up beside
the curb, Lily jumped out in the roadway, into the mud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; she said to Mrs. Clifton, &#8220;mother, I shall
never forget this!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, mechanically, in her haste to get away, she
handed the man what money she had left, made a sign to
him to go on and, without saying good-by, Lily
saw the cab drive off. It was evening, in a quiet
street: where was she? Lily did not know; her head
was in a whirl. She recognized Old Compton Street:
had they gone no farther? It seemed to her that she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
been riding for an hour ... but no, barely a few
minutes....</p>
<p>Alone in London, without money, in the mud, in the
dark, oh! she wished she could be swallowed up in the
sewer. She felt like killing herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I walk toward the Thames,&#8221; she muttered, &#8220;I am
done for!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she took a street on the left, leading in the direction
of the embankment. The movement restored her to
her self-consciousness.</p>
<p>An idea came to her, a distant hope, a glimmer, very
faint at first, which suddenly grew in dimensions within
her and lit her up in every particle. Jimmy! He appeared
to her, all at once, like a giant eight feet high, as
on his posters. Ah, people seemed to associate her life
with his, to presume all sorts of things ... though he
had never even kissed her! Yes, he had ... on the
stage ... in Berlin, but that was before everybody!
And everything drove her toward him, she always found
herself on his path: Jimmy was everywhere, always. And
Jimmy was powerful and he was good-looking and he
loved her! He loved her! To keep straight was no use.
Why, all of them, all of them, including her husband, that
footy rotter, who was jealous of Jimmy without reason:
she&#8217;d give him cause for jealousy soon, if it killed him
with rage, him and all the rotten lot. And she&#8217;d do it
that very moment! At two minutes&#8217; walk from where
she stood, in Whitcomb Mansions! She was not one of
those women whom you can drive to despair with impunity:
she had her vengeance ready....</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Jimmy was alone in his room; his table was covered
with books and papers. He was still at his great plan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>Jimmy sat plunged in work, without the least thought
of what was happening near him: in fact, he did not even
know that Lily was in London. His installation of &#8220;Bridging
the Abyss&#8221; at the Hippodrome had taken him the
whole day. There was a scenic effect to contrive with the
manager: a &#8220;hydrodrama&#8221; ... bridging the abyss
over a torrent ... with a waterfall behind ...
and the whole thing set and framed in a pantomine, which
was ready for production, because Jimmy had been expected
for a month; in short, it would go of itself.</p>
<p>And under the peaceful light he resumed his compasses,
or else flung himself back in his chair, lit a cigarette,
followed the smoke with his eyes....</p>
<p>Poor Lily, what was she doing, over there, in Berlin,
thought Jimmy. She deserved something better than
Trampy, that adorable Lily, to whom he, Jimmy, would
gladly have devoted his life ... and whom he felt as
it were swelling up inside him ... in his heart ...
in his brain ... in spite of himself! That poor Lily!
To think that he could do nothing for her, that he almost
regretted having done her a service, after the short scene
which he had had the day after with Trampy, blinded with
jealousy, because he, Jimmy, had visited Lily during his
absence; the reproaches which that simple action had
earned for him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, you righter of wrongs, you who preach
to others and go making love to their wives!&#8221;</p>
<p>To have put himself in a position that he could be
spoken to like that, in a position to have Lily suspected!
What a shame! Oh, the worries it would cause her! Yes,
he had been imprudent, perhaps: it was all his fault; another
man&#8217;s wife....</p>

&#8220;Oh, you mean cur!&#8221; roared Lily.<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>A tap at the door. It was opened behind him, before he
had time to say, &#8220;Come in,&#8221; and Lily walked up to Jimmy,
who sat dumb with surprise: a strange Lily, feverish, distraught
with passion. At any other time, she would have
felt constrained, because of the thousand marks, or proud
to show off her dress. Perhaps also she had prepared
things to say. But all that was forgotten, gone, blown
away, like a straw in the storm, for nothing came from
her but this, in an anxious voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Jimmy, is it true that you love me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Jimmy, perceiving Lily&#8217;s agitation, without
guessing the reason: oh, but for Lily to do a thing
like that! How she would regret it later; it was terrible
this time really. He saw all that at a glance; a great pity
invaded him; and yet he was a man of flesh and blood and
felt stirred to the marrow. &#8220;Why,&#8221; he began, in a voice
which he strove to make friendly, no more, &#8220;why, Lily,
who told you that? Why really ... I....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy,&#8221; she cried, fixing her eyes, like two flaming
swords upon him, &#8220;answer me! Do you love me or not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy, turning as pale as a corpse, looked at her without
flinching and shook his head in sign of no.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean cur!&#8221; roared Lily.</p>
<p>And she struck him on the face with her clenched fist.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Then she went out without a word, ran down the
stairs, out into the blaze of Leicester Square, made for the
dark streets and plunged into the night....</p>

<h2>INTERMEZZO</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
</div>

<p>The artistes&#8217; special left Euston at noon that Sunday.
The Three Graces were the first to arrive; then the waiting-rooms,
until lately deserted, began to fill with silent
groups of five or six persons at a time, who had, no doubt,
arranged the night before, at the theater, to travel together
and avail themselves of the reduction allowed to
members of the M. H. A. R. A.: a reduction of at least
a third, provided there were five in the party. They now
swarmed into the station from every side: pale faces, under
huge feathers; wrists hooped round with bangles;
breasts bristling with gollywogs and lucky charms. There
were little girls with bows over their ears, dressed in
plush and velvet and following their Pas and Mas.
There were troupes of carpet acrobats, with low foreheads,
broad shoulders and bow legs; and profs, bosses
and managers, recognizable by the richness of their
watch-chains, looked after the luggage. Theater-vans
discharged immense basket trunks, marked with letters a
foot high&mdash;&#8220;Brothers This ... Sisters That ...
So-and-so Trio ... Miss Such-and-such&#8221;&mdash;and bearing
on the handles, on the yellow labels of the M. H.
A. R. A., addresses of Empires and Palaces and of
Grand Opera-Houses and Grand Theaters, too, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
there were not only &#8220;artistes,&#8221; but singers, actresses,
&#8220;chicken-necks,&#8221; &#8220;woolly-legs,&#8221; who rubbed shoulders
with the muscular acrobats. All of them crowded round
the booking-office; they handed in professional cards,
helped one another, among pros; those who were traveling
alone borrowed tickets to enable them to get their
over-weight luggage labeled: complicated pieces of apparatus,
nickel-plated rods wrapped up in sacking, equilibrists&#8217;
perches; the coaches, which were carried by assault,
were encumbered with hand-luggage, bags, parcels,
picture-frames containing photographs for the doors of
the theaters, heaped up in the racks, under the seats, in
the corridor; and there was a constant fire of &#8220;Hullo,
girls! Hullo, boys!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Three Graces, standing before the carriage-door,
now that their things were settled, watched this tumult
sadly, especially Thea. What was it? Nunkie&#8217;s absence?
No, but poor Lily had been kicked out by her husband, so
they heard, and turned out by her mother as well: was it
possible? Lily was dead or vanished, they didn&#8217;t know
which; they were told about it at the theater; a stagehand
had met her near St. Martin&#8217;s Lane, in a small
street, with her hair undone and her hat on the back of
her head, crying, biting her handkerchief, drunk, apparently,
and running in the direction of the Thames. And,
since then, they had had no news of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Lily, what can she have done, what can have
happened?&#8221; sighed Thea. &#8220;Poor Lily, she was always so
nice!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thea could have cried for sadness.</p>
<p>The start caused a diversion. The collector punched
the tickets:</p>
<p>&#8220;Blackpool? Glasgow?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>The Three Graces stepped in, the engine whistled. But
a porter rushed past, pushing before him, with a rumbling
like thunder, a huge trunk on a barrow. Thea
turned her head and a name in scarlet letters caught her
eyes: &#8220;Miss Lily!&#8221; And, running after the trunk, magnificently
bedecked, in a hat all feathers and gold tassels,
who? What? Lily! Lily herself, red and out of breath,
leading her bike with one hand, carrying an umbrella in
the other, and Glass-Eye, her arms stretched wide with
parcels, following in her train! Just time to throw her
bike to the porter in the luggage-van and quick, quick,
Lily came scudding back, hustled along by the train-master!
She would have missed the start, were it not for
Thea, who opened the door and, with her arms of steel,
gripped her as she passed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Lily! That&#8217;s a good girl! Quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily leaped into the carriage with a bound. Glass-Eye,
entangled in her parcels, had, amid general laughter, to
be dragged by main force, through the narrow doorway,
like a piece of luggage. Oof, just in time ... Off
they were!</p>
<p>In the railway-carriage was nothing but gaiety and
handshaking and ingenuous questions:</p>
<p>&#8220;Traveling by yourself? Where&#8217;s Trampy? And
your Pa and Ma? So you&#8217;re not dead, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;If they had come to annoy
me at the station, I&#8217;d have shown them if I was alive or
dead! I was ready for them!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she brandished her umbrella.</p>
<p>Then she had to make herself comfortable, to find
room for all her belongings as best she could. Lily
pushed Glass-Eye about, like a fine lady used to being
waited on:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here, take my hat, Glass-Eye; hang it up. Take my
wrist-bag. Wait, give me my handkerchief first!&#8221;</p>
<p>To look at Lily, all fresh and rosy, one would never
have suspected the trials she had passed through, but a
few days ago. Still quite flustered with that hurried departure,
she smiled as she watched the Three Graces, who,
on their side, were carefully folding up their cloaks. And
the train rushed on, rushed on through deep cuttings,
dashed through deserted stations ... and then, suddenly,
entered a tunnel. Lily, but for the noise of the
wheels, would have seen herself as she had been that night.
Oh, she would never forget it! It clutched at her heart.
She clenched her fists with anger. Turned out by
Trampy! Insulted by her Ma! Flouted by Jimmy, that
mean cur! Oh, when she left his place, a few days ago,
she felt like a madwoman! Her first idea was to disappear,
to take a header into the black water! But, ugh, the mud,
the cold! And then the hospital, with those people who
cut you up! She must also show Pa and Ma whether it
was through her gentlemen friends that she meant to earn
more by herself alone than they and all their rotten troupe
put together. Perhaps Pa and Ma would come to her, one
day, to beg their bread! But Ma must first ask Lily&#8217;s pardon
on her knees. On her knees, damn it! And, in despair,
inwardly raging, her chest aching with grief and spite,
Lily, penniless, but brave for all that and ready for the
fray, returned to her hotel, where, to her great surprise,
she found some one waiting for her, with a parcel in her
hand.</p>
<p>Lily recognized Glass-Eye.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, poor Glass-Eye. When she heard what
had happened and that Lily would starve in London and a
jolly good thing too, that she could sleep in Leicester
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
Square for all they cared: when she heard this behind
the door, Glass-Eye almost fainted. Without a word
to a soul, she had packed up her parcel and gone to join
Lily; and Lily, in her misery, cried for joy when she saw
the decent girl, who offered her her savings, twelve shillings
in all, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me with you, Miss Lily; I&#8217;ll wait on you for
nothing. Take me, take me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, not to feel alone, to have some one beside you who
loves you: that had consoled Lily....</p>
<p>The next day, accompanied by Glass-Eye, she called
on the agents, in the Leicester Square quarter, at the
risk of meeting Pa, or Trampy, or Jimmy; but who
cared? With her umbrella in her hand, she feared nobody
and did not give a fig for any of them.</p>
<p>Nothing for her at Harrasford&#8217;s, where the Warwicks
were starring. Very well, she&#8217;d come back again some
other time! And straight on to Bill and Boom&#8217;s in Whitcomb
Mansions, below Jimmy. As she climbed the
stairs, Lily screwed up her eyes, like a short-sighted person,
for fear of meeting Jimmy, prepared a haughty attitude;
but she saw no one. She was not kept waiting,
was shown in at once to Boom&#8217;s office. Lily Clifton?
the New Zealander on Wheels? Straight away a
contract! And Lily left with twenty music-halls
in her pocket! Liverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield and
so on: a week in each town, beginning on Monday next.
And that was how she got engagements through her gentlemen
friends!</p>
<p>The next day, she borrowed some money on her contracts
from the Brixton financier: &#8220;loans from five
pounds upward, in the strictest confidence.&#8221; Then, proposed
and seconded by two artistes, she joined the Variety
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
Artistes&#8217; Federation and, in return for ten shillings, received
the red card of membership. She paid another ten
shillings and the same for Glass-Eye, her maid, to the M.
H. A. R. A. and obtained the right, for one year, to travel
at reduced fares, including an insurance against accidents:
five hundred pounds to her heirs in case of death&mdash;her
heirs!&mdash;and two hundred and fifty pounds if she lost a
hand or foot in a railway accident; and one hundred and
fifty for a serious injury. Then she bought a big gollywog,
for her dressing-room, and a little lucky charm
for her watch-chain&mdash;a closed black hand, with the
thumb between the fingers, as a preservative against falls&mdash;and
with that and her bike she would have set out for
India and Australia as calmly as she might have taken the
omnibus to Earl&#8217;s Court.</p>
<p>Oh yes, she had done a deal in those few days and,
above all, she had got out of her difficulties, thanks, to
a certain extent, to Glass-Eye, who had comforted her.
And besides, hang it, that was all over now! The worries
were forgotten, and, as the train emerged from the
tunnel, Lily, with her arm round Glass-Eye&#8217;s waist, was
patting that decent girl and Glass-Eye lifted her one good
eye to Lily, while the other, the glass one, gazing fixedly
at the door, reflected the thinly scattered houses and the
beginning of the country.</p>
<p>Lily, when she had recovered a little from her mad
rush, lay down at full length among her bags, parcels
and bandboxes. She laughed with the Three Graces;
and there was no one there to interfere with them;
there they were, by themselves, among themselves, alone
in the compartment, a regular, rollicking school-girls&#8217;
picnic. Lily made them scream by telling them about
her life since they had last seen her. She felt a need for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
a reaction of gaiety, after her sadness of the days just
past. The Graces fixed their round eyes upon her, upon
that Lily who was so thoroughly up in all sorts of things
which they knew only by hearsay: men, love. A life fit
to kill a horse; and a very nice girl, for all that: a kind of
forbidden fruit, pink and fair-haired, soft to the touch;
and no jealousy between them, friendship rather, a rare
thing, in the &#8220;Profession&#8221;....</p>
<p>Lily grew excited in talking, told of her successes, the
receptions, the teas she used to give in her drawing-room,
in Berlin, when she was ill. Jossers, according to her,
would have paid any price to have been there! It would
form a subject of conversation over there for many a
long day to come. And then her journeys, her impressions
of the continent&mdash;&#8220;Jam with your meat, my dear!&#8221;&mdash;and
such clean dressing-rooms in Germany; very severe
managers, though: gee, harder than Pas. But very
good to her, all the same. The Battenberg at Leipzig:
nothing but leading turns; and she had topped the bill at
Leipzig! And to see all those people eating, during the
show, when you were hungry yourself, had a very funny
effect upon you. By the way, she didn&#8217;t like that system of
being lodged and boarded by the management; it was
all very well for those people; but none of that for her:
give her a nice flat in town or a smart hotel! Once she
was started, Lily never stopped, called Glass-Eye to witness,
went on telling of her life in Berlin; how Jimmy
had fallen in love with her when he saw her on the stage,
and he had the cheek to want her to run away with him;
but who got a box on the ear that day, eh? She perhaps:
yes, rather, over the left! And Jimmy and Trampy had
fought for her! So had all the pros, worse than dogs in
September!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What a rotten lot!&#8221; concluded Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, how you&#8217;ve changed!&#8221; said Thea. &#8220;You used to
be so fond of men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I give it them where they deserve,&#8221; said Lily, slapping
her firm, round hips.</p>
<p>And they laughed noisily at Lily&#8217;s anger when, with
her shoulder drawn back and her arm ready to strike, she
spoke of breaking the jaws of those two scoundrels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go it! Hit me!&#8221; said Thea, putting forward her
deltoid muscle. &#8220;Hit away! You&#8217;ll only smash your
wrist!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then those Spartans calmed down, asked one another
for news of absent friends, talked about different
people they had known, all over the place, on the stage:
their conversation always came round to the profession.
Lily, with greater refinement, sometimes tried to discuss
dress: tulle ruches were to be worn this year, she heard;
feather boas. The Graces knew nothing about that, stuck
to their &#8220;Did you ever know...? Do you remember...?&#8221;
And every part of the world was mixed
up in their talk: India, Tasmania, Mexico, South Wales,
New South Wales, York, New York, Hampshire, New
Hampshire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know Ave Maria?&#8221; asked Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they mentioned other friends, like school-girls living
in the same quarter; only, for them, the school, the quarter
was San Francisco, Chicago, Berlin, and the schoolmates
were the girl in a knot, who had sold her skeleton
in advance to the Medical College: Marjutti, the double-knotted
girl, to whom the South Kensington Museum
offered five hundred pounds for a cast of her figure;
the Pawnees, who had just won a treble beauty prize;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
and the Laurence girl, whose cruelly daring performance
was forbidden by the Manchester police; and heaps of
others whom they had known and who, at that moment,
were asleep at the antipodes, right under your feet, or
waking up in the Far West, or going to bed in the Far
East, or pitching on the ocean, or rolling in express trains
toward the five corners of the earth. And their own traveling
adventures, the Graces&#8217; and Lily&#8217;s: broken railway-bridges!
ships on fire at sea! towns blazing up in the
night! ropes breaking, falls head-first, my! One would
have thought that these girls of seventeen to twenty were
South Sea pirates, talking of hangings and tortures, or,
rather, children playing at frightening one another. Lily,
for instance, in India: two eyes glaring at her in the dark,
gee! And, in New York, a fall into a mirror; all over
blood; half dead. She grew excited, in her desire to outdo
Laurence and Crack-o&#8217;-Whip: the steel-buckled belt, the
kicks in the ribs! Stories of brutal treatment picked up on
every side&mdash;from the Gilson girl, from Ave Maria, from
all the boys and all the girls and all the monkeys who had
been through the mill&mdash;she made every one of them her
own, served them up hot and hot to the astounded Graces,
talked of whole days spent in practising on rough, uneven
boards&mdash;&#8220;And given no food, was I, Glass-Eye?&#8221;&mdash;so
much so that she would sometimes get up in the night
and go and pick up the crusts under the table, gee! Lily
reveled in the pitying expressions of the Three Graces
and her heart swelled with pride when Thea, greatly
touched, remarked that, in such cases, it would have been
better not to be born.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite right,&#8221; said Lily, with a drooping air;
but she burst into a peal of fresh, young laughter when
she saw Glass-Eye overcome with emotion. &#8220;What&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
that?&#8221; asked Lily, giving her a thump in the ribs. &#8220;Crying?
You silly cuckoo!&#8221;</p>
<p>If it hadn&#8217;t been for her Ma&#8217;s insults and Jimmy&#8217;s and
Trampy&#8217;s&mdash;when it all came back to her, it was like a
needle stuck in her heart!&mdash;Lily would have been in the
seventh heaven! No more Pa, no more Ma, no more anybody;
no boss, no prof, no husband, nothing, all alone
... with her maid! Certainly, there would be the
worry of business, looking for her &#8220;digs,&#8221; seeing the
agents, writing letters and so on; but she would know
how to put herself forward, how to make the most of her
work; and she smiled as she reflected how little all those
worries meant, compared with her past life: and she
would be free, free, free at last. She was going to earn
money, to enjoy life.</p>
<p>And the train rushed on, rushed on through the fields.
Glass-Eye, with her nose glued to the window, was astonished
to find everything so large outside of London: red
villages decked the green country-side; and then came
empty railway stations. Sometimes the train slowed down:&mdash;a
large silent town lay spread in the valley, white smoke
rose from the endless roofs; homes, more homes; the air
of rest, the empty streets and the indistinct chimes of
the church-bells proclaimed to the pale heavens the
majesty of prayer. Lily listened with a dreamy air; it all
reminded her of things:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like the American engines,&#8221; she said to the Three
Graces, &#8220;that used to ring their bells when they passed
through Syracuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the train rushed on, rushed on.... And
they again began to talk shop, as always: with, here
and there, an excursion into the cost of food. The
Graces, just then, were unpacking their lunch; and Lily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
fetched her traveling provisions from her bag in the corridor.
There was a sound of clattering plates from end
to end of the train, in a mist of tobacco-smoke. Lily
rejoined the party very quickly, to avoid coming in contact
with the pros, and, waited on by Glass-Eye, attacked
her meal and broke her bread so heartily that the
crusts flew to the ceiling. They drank out of the same
cup, took their meat in their hands, Lily saying that fingers
were made before forks. They chattered noisily,
with the time-honored jokes about apples and bananas.
They made Glass-Eye talk a lot of nonsense. Lily, flinging
back her head, laughed full-throated, held her sides.</p>
<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; said the Graces. &#8220;What a pity that we are
separating! It would have been so nice to travel together;
one&#8217;s never bored with you. What a tomboy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;K you!&#8221; said Lily, greatly flattered, with a stage
curtsey.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they would have to part at Warrington.
The Graces were going on to Glasgow, Lily was
changing for Liverpool; a few moments more and it was
good-by, until chance....</p>
<p>At Lily&#8217;s request, the Graces gave her a few last words
of advice, explained the system of the pass-book of the
Artistes&#8217; Federation: the sixpenny stamp to be stuck in
the little square every week; the extra stamp at each
death of a member, for the benefit of the heirs. They
talked to her of the Friday meetings at Manchester, at
which every artiste can speak and see himself printed
afterward in the London <i>Performer</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; thought Lily. &#8220;I may have things to say.
There will be news for somebody!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Graces had a &#8220;three years&#8217; book,&#8221; the professional
<i>agenda</i>, with nothing but Mondays marked on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
it for the weekly engagement: 8 January, 15 January
and so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;Mine&#8217;s full for months
ahead!&#8221;</p>
<p>They showed her, on theirs, the last pages containing
portrait advertisements of famous artistes: the Pawnees,
Marjutti, Laurence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if I could get there one day!&#8221; thought Lily. &#8220;I&#8217;d
post it to Pa; it would be the death of him!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then followed the thousand and one details of the
wandering life: your name on the red list, the list handed
in at the station; the journeys at reduced fares; the music
for twelve instruments, forty executants, sent on to the
theater a fortnight in advance.</p>
<p>&#8220;And matinées are paid for now. And you know, Lily,
in the Federation you can get a solicitor free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good thing to know,&#8221; thought Lily, &#8220;for my
divorce from that rusty biker!&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, how she hated pros, now! The sight of them in
the corridor, looking at her with glistening eyes, made
her want to put out her tongue at them! But she preferred
not to see:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to seem stuck-up with them, it&#8217;s not
polite,&#8221; she observed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she shrugged her shoulders when one of
them who, no doubt, had known her when she was &#8220;that
high,&#8221; blew kisses to her from the tips of his fingers, with
a gesture straight at her heart, through the window.</p>
<p>And the train rushed on, rushed on. They were nearing
Warrington. The slopes, on either side, bristled with
chimneys and houses, houses, endless roofs ... a
Lancashire rid of its black smoke, like an extinct and
silent crater ... Warrington!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>A few minutes&#8217; wait. There was a general hustle, pros
stretching their legs, running to the refreshment-room
for a drink, some seeking seats in the train, others saying
good-by:</p>
<p>&#8220;Write to me, eh? Cathedral Hotel, Melbourne.&#8221;</p>
<p>And a shake of the hand; so long; perhaps for ever.
More basket trunks were being trundled down the platform.
A wife was leaving her husband: six months,
twelve months, without meeting; who could tell? Or else,
perhaps, between two trains, as the luck of the tours
would have it; and they seemed very fond of each other,
too; Lily thought it very pretty. But she had other
things to do than sentimentalize. She handed out her
parcels to Glass-Eye and then, standing on the platform,
said good-by to the Three Graces:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope you&#8217;ll have a good journey! <i>Au revoir</i>! Send
me some post-cards,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;Address them to the
theater, I love that! Good-by! Ta-ta!&#8221;</p>
<p>The train started. Lily waved her handkerchief to the
Three Graces.</p>
<p>One more separation; one more little rent: Lily had
had so many in her life. As far back as she could remember
there had been heads at the carriage-window,
like that; ships standing out to sea; trains rushing into
the night. But, this time, she was alone, with her maid.
And she drew herself up proudly, like a lady who had a
sense of her responsibilities. A new life was opening before
Lily, as before a girl just coming out. Poor Lily,
a girl still, in her way, yes, with, for her portion, a feather
in her hat, a gollywog in her trunk, a pair of supple legs
and nerves of steel, unerring and exact, trained to turn
round and round....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Liverpool! Come along, Glass-Eye!&#8221; said Lily, jogging
her maid in the ribs.</p>
<p>Glass-Eye, half asleep, clumsily gathered up her parcels,
while Lily looked round for the baggage-man. On
the platform was an avalanche of bags, boxes, picture-frames,
as at the departure from Euston; the basket
trunks were being piled up in the theater-vans. Lily
pointed out her hamper and her bike to the boy from the
theater, who had come to meet the &#8220;program&#8221; at the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you the bicyclist?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; replied Lily modestly.</p>
<p>She gave her address: not the pros&#8217; boarding-house,
but private &#8220;digs&#8221; which had been recommended to her
in London, with a note of introduction. Then she walked
out of the station, followed by Glass-Eye.</p>
<p>Lily knew Liverpool, vaguely, as she knew all the
towns of the United Kingdom and those of America, too,
and Australia and India and Germany and Holland and
elsewhere. They were all muddled up in her memory, she
had seen so many, and made as it were one great city,
but for occasional salient points, as in the towns which
you came to in a boat, or those in which you had a circus
parade, or others still, here and there: Glasgow, where
she had fallen and broken a tooth; Blackpool with its
ball-rooms, its tower and a &#8220;contract!&#8221; Sheffield, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
its smoking chimneys; Washington, with a dome at the
end; New York, with its sky-scrapers. The towns of her
early childhood, leaning against mountains, buried under
trees, were more remote, more like a dream. Elephants,
monkeys, harnessed buffaloes; and then Mexico and Ave
Maria, London and those footy rotters!</p>
<p>Liverpool was Lime Street: Lily remembered a sort of
round church; when you got to that, you turned to the
left. She soon found the house and received from a huge,
full-blown lady the friendly welcome which Lily&#8217;s artless
air and fair curls always insured her. No gentleman
with them? All alone by themselves? A room with a
big double bed, a little parlor with a bow-window; sixteen
shillings a week, including the use of the kitchen.
Just then, the baggage-man arrived, took the trunk up
to the room and went on with the bike to the pros&#8217; boarding-house
and the theater. Lily, assisted by Glass-Eye,
fixed herself up for the week: her dresses on the pegs,
her linen safe under lock and key in the hamper. Then
she made a special parcel of things for the stage: paper
flowers, ostrich feathers, white laced boots.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, wrap that up in my petticoat,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;And
the music and the gollywog: you can bring all that to my
dressing-room to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next, Lily made herself look smart, freshened up her
two bows, threw her green muslin scarf over her shoulders
and went down to the parlor to pick out her favorite
tune&mdash;<i>The Bluebells of Scotland</i>&mdash;with one finger on the
piano. Meanwhile, the landlady spread the cloth: bread,
marmalade, watercress, two eggs. Then, according to instructions
received, Glass-Eye announced to Miss Lily
that tea was ready. Lily affably invited Glass-Eye to sit
down to table with her; and the two ate away like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
friends. Lily took the opportunity to settle her expenses;
for instance&mdash;and this she insisted upon&mdash;if she, Lily,
took a maid, she wouldn&#8217;t
have her for nothing; she
intended to pay her some
small monthly wage.</p>
<p>&#8220;And a good many little
perquisites besides, you
understand, Glass-Eye; my
old frocks, my hats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glass-Eye did not ask
that, would have given her
other eye to serve Miss Lily.</p>
<p>Lily was still asleep, at
twelve o&#8217;clock the next
morning, when Glass-Eye
entered the room. She had
lost her way, had walked
miles, had been to the landing-stage
of the music-hall....</p>
<p>&#8220;At what time&#8217;s rehearsal?&#8221;
asked Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;At one o&#8217;clock, Miss
Lily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you let me sleep
till twelve, when I have so
much to do!&#8221; said Lily.
&#8220;Go and get breakfast
ready ... or you&#8217;d
better mind yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily put out her
hand to lay hold of a boot;
but Glass-Eye was gone.</p>
<div class='figright'>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>Lily, while dressing, reflected upon her new responsibilities,
upon the way in which servants should be treated.
No familiarity; not too severe, either; and no smackings
... that is to say ... however ...</p>
<p>&#8220;I must dress her simply,&#8221; thought Lily. &#8220;My hats,
but without the feathers; coarse thread gloves; and she
must always carry a parcel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily was eager to go to rehearsal, accompanied by her
maid. There is no rehearsing at &#8220;rehearsal:&#8221; the &#8220;times,&#8221;
the scenic effects are settled with the conductor of the
band; there are no bare arms or bloomers practising
on their carpets: a few dark groups, in ordinary walking
dress; others, in their shirt sleeves, are opening boxes,
and no mystery, no shifting lights: the stage and the
house one wan hole, except the red and gold note of the
curtain and the black mass of the musicians, with the
gleaming brasses.</p>
<p>The artistes went up to the conductor, one after the
other, and explained their &#8220;turns:&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I come on, this tune, soft, six times, to begin
with; then, once, loud. When I go off ... a roll
of drums.&#8221;</p>
<p>The band, each time, played two or three bars, mechanically,
at sight; then it was understood and ...
next, please.</p>
<p>Lily had seen this before, but not under these conditions;
not dressed as at present; not accompanied by a
maid. She listened as hard as she could when she walked
on to the stage, caught the remarks, enjoyed the impression
which she produced. They seemed to ask:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it? A singer? A dancer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Lily; Miss Lily, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>She guessed all that. Then:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My score, Maud!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, leaning toward the orchestra, she explained, in
her turn: pizzicati, mazurka, frog, swan, back-wheel, the
waltz for the twirls, the march for the exit. And
Lily withdrew with a half-curtsey and a pretty smile.
Next, she put out her things in her dressing-room, on
the table, before the looking-glass: brushes, pencils,
grease-paints, strings of pearls for her hair. She
hung a cord from the door to the window, to dry her
tights on, when she washed a pair in the basin. She got
out her little work-box, in case of anything tearing,
threaded a needle, freshened up the knots of her ribbons,
pinned photographs and p.-c.&#8217;s on the wall. And, over
all, she hung her gollywog, a hairy doll, white-collared,
red-waistcoated, with, in its black face, under the
bristling hair, two shining tacks by way of eyes. It
was the protecting idol. Not that Lily, ever faithful to the
Church of England, believed much in gollywogs; but, like
most music-hall people, she felt safer when she knew it
was there. And her dressing-room, with the spangled
skirts and the tights hanging down like flayed skins, suggested
some strange, exotic chapel in which a fetish sat
enthroned.</p>
<p>After that, Lily had nothing left to do. She went out
with Glass-Eye and walked round to the front to look at
her lithos. She saw to her annoyance that a serio was
topping the bill&mdash;and a comic singer middling it and
a cinematograph bottoming it. But no matter, she had
a good place, just under the bill-topper.</p>
<p>Next came shopping, through the windows. She
bought a pair of thread gloves for Glass-Eye at Lewis&#8217;s
and then went in and lay on her bed, feeling ever
so tired from getting up late that morning. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
dreamed and dreamed, while Glass-Eye went marketing.
As soon as Lily was alone, the thought pricked her
like a pin: looking pretty, indeed! Her gentlemen friends!
Jimmy, that traitor, and Trampy! Trampy would be
sure to play her some dirty trick. Oh, if she could
get a divorce from him, in spite of all! She had made
inquiries in London. She would want a solicitor. She
must have one, to set inquiries on foot.... She could
have as many witnesses as she pleased: all those girls
... and the stage hands ... and two artistes,
on the day when Trampy, in his fury, had flung his bike
at her on the stairs; the pedal had grazed her temple, yes,
at Dresden. That wasn&#8217;t the way to treat a lady. Everything
that had happened was his fault; and they&#8217;d see
who won the day, he or she. Her forehead wrinkled
up with anger when she thought of it. She bit her
lips and clenched her fists and then ... and then
... enough of that! She&#8217;d see to-morrow. And other
cares came to bother her: the indispensable things which
she would have to buy at the end of the week out of her
salary; open-work stockings, an aigrette for the theater, a
little black bog-oak pig to wear at her wrist. And Jimmy&#8217;s
thousand marks ...</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it, let him wait!&#8221; And, with her hand on her
lucky charm, Lily fell asleep.</p>
<p>In the evening, at the theater, she forgot everything.
She felt a longing, a fevered desire to appear. When her
turn came, after the xylophones, who seemed, behind their
tables laden with bottles, to be keeping a bar of musical
sounds; when the light shining on the great back-drop
threw up into dazzling relief the blue sea, the blue sky and
the white colonnade and terraces; when, amid the flash of
the lime-light and the thunder of the orchestra, she made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
her entrance on the stage, Lily had a smile of triumph.
Life was beginning for her at last! She could have cried
out for happiness to that human mass which, behind the
flaming streak of the footlights, spread itself, bare-necked
and bedizened, in the warm shadow of the front
boxes. And she directed a scarlet smile, set off with a
glint of gold, to the audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I was grand to-night,&#8221; said Lily, as she went
off, out of breath. &#8220;Oh, if there had been an agent in the
house! But no such luck: they&#8217;re never there when they&#8217;re
wanted! And those two fellows,&#8221; she thought to herself.
&#8220;If they had been there, they&#8217;d have died of jealousy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everybody spoiled her. She needed a strong head
to resist the flatteries with which she was overwhelmed,
both as artiste and woman. For instance, when a row
of Roofers were puffing away on the stage, some manager,
who had known her when she was &#8220;that high,&#8221; was
sure to observe that her talent, her firm, round hips&mdash;&#8220;Eh,
Lily, you&#8217;ve got plenty of that now!&#8221; ... Lily
blushed under the compliment&mdash;would make more impression
than a whole herd of Roofers:</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, Lily? I say, what are you doing to-night? Come
and have some ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glass-Eye, my handkerchief,&#8221; Lily broke in, suspecting
an invitation to supper.</p>
<p>Glass-Eye, in obedience to a gesture of Lily&#8217;s, opened
the wrist-bag, gave Lily the lace handkerchief and Lily
hid her mocking smile in a scented gesture. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by. Ta-ta!&#8221;</p>
<p>And they shook hands, like good friends, nothing
more.</p>
<p>Glass-Eye frightened off the admirers with her fixed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
stare. And Lily had no lack of them. She loved flirting.
She wanted adulation, wanted to be made much
of. She had a revenge to take, arrears to make up; she
and sympathy had, till then, been strangers. She now
took her fill of it, got carried away, saw nothing but lovers
around her, three or four at a time, as when the comic
quartet, the Out-of-Tunes, used to grin kisses to her in
the street. It was for her that they were there, every
one of them, down to the acting managers, who did not
disdain to come round from the front and take a turn on
the stage. It might be a question of steam-pipes or electric
wires; no matter, Lily took it all to herself, made
herself amiable toward their dress-coats and white shirt-fronts,
and said &#8220;&#8217;K you!&#8221; with the great stage bow, the
body bent in a sweeping curtsey, when they complimented
her on her firm, round hips. She stabbed them with
smiles, to make sure of complimentary phrases in their
weekly reports to the central boards. All of them;
the electrician, the conductor of the band, she had them
all at her feet. It became a need for Lily to see people
all around her dying for love. It gave her a feeling of
mingled pride and remorse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I help it, Glass-Eye?&#8221; she would ask, to quiet
her conscience. &#8220;They&#8217;re mad. They would leave their
wives and children for me!&#8221;</p>
<p>She had an autograph album filled with &#8220;thoughts&#8221;
and declarations:</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you! <i>Je vous aime! Ich liebe dich</i>!&#8221;</p>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>Lily, now that the audience was good for invitations
to supper, bouquets and sweets, occupied herself
with that somber mass which, formerly, did not cause
her so much uneasiness as the presence of her Pa. Lily,
like a real stage-girl, who had beheld waves miles high
between Harwich and the Hook of Holland, saw in a
few flowers a bouquet large enough to fill a cab and the
least little love letter grew, in her eyes, into an offer to
present her with motor-cars and to abandon wife and
child. If a gentleman, for once in a way, stood on the
pavement waiting for her, she dreamed of an elopement.
And there were pros, too, who prowled around her, in
the half light of the wings, and came up to her with
outstretched hand:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Mrs. Trampy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Call me Miss Lily,&#8221; she said, in a vexed voice.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the name I&#8217;m known by.&#8221;</p>
<p>And many of them did know her, in fact, from having
talked about her in Fourteenth Street in New York, or
in State Street at Sidney, or in the theaters in South
Africa, for that story of the whippings had traveled all
around the world, under the folds of the Union Jack.
Some proposed to take her with them in their show, or to
go with her to clean her bike, instead of Glass-Eye:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a bargain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I <i>don&#8217;t</i> think!&#8221; said Lily.</p>
<p>Another, just off for Melbourne, told her that, in
Australia, you could find fire-escapes to marry you for
half-a-crown. They joked without constraint, in the
pros&#8217; smoking-room, a small and dark corner between
the house and the stage.... All of them, all the pros,
she had them all at her feet; but she didn&#8217;t care for that
sort and she sent them all to eat coke.</p>
<p>The months all passed alike. She had finished the
Bill and Boom tour. She continued in the private
music-halls, from north to south, from east to west of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
England. In spite of Glass-Eye&#8217;s impossible cooking and
the everlasting ham sandwiches and pork-pies of the railway
station refreshment rooms, Lily grew plumper and
plumper, her nervous leanness filled out, with pigeon&#8217;s
eggs and ostrich&#8217;s eggs everywhere, in front and behind.
She did not kill herself with work. Once, in Glasgow, at
a music-hall where, a few weeks earlier, Laurence had
had a terrible fall, lying unconscious for two whole hours,
the frightened manager said:</p>
<p>&#8220;No dangerous tricks, mind! They only get us into
trouble!&#8221;</p>
<p>Another time, she was given only seven minutes,
watch in hand, on the stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you cut that little trick? You know the one
I mean,&#8221; said the manager.</p>
<p>He called a little trick a performance which it had
cost her eighteen months&#8217; hard practice and no end of
bruises to learn. Lily did not wait to be asked twice.
She cut as desired and thought it a jolly lot easier to trot
round quietly, as though out for a ride, with pretty smiles
to the audience. She ended by paying more attention to
her dresses than to her work:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not so much what one does,&#8221; she said, &#8220;as the way
one does it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sympathy with which she was surrounded unmanned
the Spartan in her. She strove to please, no
longer gave her performance for herself, like a machine,
unerring and exact. Already in a few months, she was
spoiled. She looked for adventitious successes. She said,
&#8220;The audience is very cold at Birmingham,&#8221; because she
was not asked out to supper, and, &#8220;They do like artistes
at Sheffield, gee!&#8221; because a gentleman had sent her
champagne and flowers in her dressing-room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>In the towns where she played three times a day&mdash;a
matinée and two night turns&mdash;she gave half of her performance,
cut whatever was dangerous or tiring. She
never practised now; just went down in the morning to
fetch her letters at the theater, where she loved receiving
them, post-cards especially, which any one could
read. She said to the jossers:</p>
<p>&#8220;Send me lots; talk about motor-cars and champagne
suppers: that drives the pros wild.&#8221;</p>
<p>She left them lying on the table, or else walked about
on the stage, with her letters in her hand, like a lady
overwhelmed with offers, with invitations. If, by any
chance, she went to the practice at the end of the week,
it was to display her hat, her new boots; and she
laughed to herself when she saw the artistes, each on
his carpet, fagging away like mad. She felt like a
fine lady visiting a boarding-school, among those little
girls practising their flip-flaps or gluing themselves
to the wall to try their back-bendings. The pride of a
Marjutti, who, they said, tortured her spinal column to
achieve a double knot; the inordinate ambition of a
Laurence, risking her life for the pleasure of risking it,
were things which she did not understand. And then,
all those accidents! Dolly Pawnee, the other day, had
broken her arm at the New York Hippodrome; the Gilson
girl had fallen on her head at Budapest. They
were mad, thought Lily, to do all that without being
obliged to! No, no; no more of that for her! The last
thing she wanted was to spoil her face, seeing that she
had nothing but her smile to keep her. And Lily grew
timid, looked upon herself more and more as a very
precious little thing. She gave herself terrible airs on rehearsal
day; thought the stage too slippery, or too small.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
Lily wanted a stage thirty feet wide, no less; she who,
in the old days, at a gesture from Pa, would have performed
her whole turn, including the head-on-the-saddle,
on the top of a cab or on the Stoke Newington pavement.
Formerly, she used to think everything good, did not
know what fatigue meant; now, in the middle of her turn,
she would say to herself, sometimes with a feeling of discouragement:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only done half. I&#8217;ve still got this and that to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the audience itself seemed to act as her confederate.
When she missed one of her tricks, Lily would lay
her bike on the stage, step down to the footlights, bow
with a confused air, beg pardon with a smile and receive
a reassuring round of applause. Lily loved these refined
audiences: <i>her</i> audiences, as she said; not the matinée
audiences, with seats at reduced prices: to see your grocer
or your butcher in the front boxes was rotten; and those
people gave themselves such airs. A cheap way of doing
the grand!</p>
<p>And the landladies spoiled her, too; those worthy souls
who treated her as their own daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;And a jolly sight better!&#8221; thought Lily.</p>
<p>Others pitied her for the profession she followed,
feared she would break something, one fine day. Lily
thought that very sweet of them, would have liked to stay
with them for ever; but there was the constant rent at
parting, a bit of herself which Lily left behind her every
week. And the bothers that Maud caused her! Her
stupidity drove Lily mad: tickets lost, bags mislaid,
disputes with the tradesmen, battles with the bike,
scratches on the shins, on the hands, everywhere. Lily
lost patience, threatened her with the leather belt,
damn it!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>Sometimes, Lily became incensed with herself and
everybody. Her divorce kept running in her head. And
her three years&#8217; book, with its last pages unsoiled by
engagements, also gave her cause for uneasiness; and
yet the acting managers must have sung her praises, in
their weekly reports,&mdash;the ones who came and made
love to her on the stage!</p>
<p>After different music-halls, she had done the Harrasford
tour, but without any great success. People who
had known her with the troupe thought that she had gone
off. Lily was furious: if, on those evenings, she missed
a trick, she would knock Glass-Eye about when she returned
to the wings, storm at the stage&mdash;&#8220;Slippery as
ice, damn it!&#8221;&mdash;fling her bike, which was not to blame,
against the wall. Lily, in her pink tights, under the pendants
of false pearls on her forehead, looked like an
angry savage, ready to fly at your throat.</p>
<p>That was her life. No adventures, really; theaters in
which she caught on, theaters in which she didn&#8217;t go
down so well; more or less prolonged applause; an encore
or two; and, here and there, a bouquet large enough
to fill a cab: those were the great events. And it was
always the same show, on the same stage, from one end
of England to the other; theaters and theaters; so many
theaters that, in her memory, they ended, like the towns,
by making only one. It was always herds of Roofers,
swaying in unison, with flaxen wigs, scarlet legs, boyish
voices; and &#8220;families,&#8221; &#8220;sisters,&#8221; &#8220;brothers,&#8221; all different,
but all alike, going up the staircase to their dressing-rooms
in wraps, like gouty people at a spa, and serios,
serios, with choruses emphasized by dances. Sometimes,
a new attraction, a Venus without tights, or a bare-breasted
Salome, would draw whole groups, boys and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
girls mixed, to the wings, with their necks stretched
toward the stage. And there were exotic features, too:
conjurers from Malabar; boomerang-throwing bush-men;
the Light of Asia, a Chinese girl without arms,
an artificial product, like those beggar-monsters whom
they cultivate in pots in the mountains of Navarre. She
saw the boy-violinist again. Since that bite in the seat
of his trousers, at Budapest, he had abandoned all hope
of fame and was looking for an engagement in the
orchestra. She saw the female-impersonator with the
green eyes. She saw numbers and numbers. She ended
by seeing them all again, in the various greenrooms.
She heard names mentioned. People were coming on
all round: Tom, singing-girls, dancing-girls. She would
have to do something, too, after all, to get herself
talked about! She had received a shock on opening
<i>The Era</i>: they had not taken out her name! There
was still a Miss Lily at Rathbone Place: her cousin
Daisy, it appeared, a stranger, was there in her stead,
under her name! And they were stealing her idea!
The New Zealanders were now called the New Trickers;
no doubt the turn which she had described to Pa.
Something new, something new was essential. She must
manage to hit upon something! She turned it all over
in her head. There were too many Lilies, Lilians, Lillians;
you saw nothing but Lillians on the posters. But
what about a Lilia Godiva, quite naked on her bike,
like the other on her horse? She would mimic the
scene, love and despair, and she would think of something
to raise a laugh! Peeping Tom, for instance,
stretching out his neck and stealing a kiss as she passed.
Oh, she would find a way&mdash;trust her!&mdash;of showing
them what she had in her! And Jimmy and Trampy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
pursued her incessantly with their hateful memory.
Trampy, she was told, was still the darling of the fair.</p>
<p>Lily was greatly astonished that he had not tried to
obtain a divorce, on his side:</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s afraid,&#8221; she said to herself.</p>
<p>More than ever, she busied herself with collecting her
witnesses; she would soon be rid of her tramp cyclist.</p>
<p>People also talked about Jimmy, whose reputation was
still increasing. After a triumphant season at the Hippodrome,
he had left for America. Jimmy was becoming
a national champion. An article in <i>The Era</i> spoke
of &#8220;our Jimmy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a friend of yours, Lily,&#8221; people said. &#8220;You
ought to know all about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily tossed her head, like one who could say a great
deal if she would....</p>
<p>Oh, how she longed for revenge when she thought
of that! Oh, if she could only have served them out
somehow! If she could get <i>The Performer Annual</i>
to send her those questions to answer: &#8220;Q. Your
favorite town? Your favorite audience? Your idea of
marriage? Your pet aversion?&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t she give it
them hot, just! She thought of having her biography
written, the real one. She herself sometimes jotted down
things she remembered, on bits of paper, on the backs of
envelopes, in her dressing-room; arranged her picture
post-cards in order; called that writing her memoirs. She
would crush them with her successes, give names and
dates: that lord who wanted to travel with her, the fifty-pound
diamond brooch he had given her. And bouquets,
chocolates, sweets ... by the cart-load! That stage-manager
who cried when she went away! All, all in love
with her: yes, those and ever so many more!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>She had so much to say that she did not know where
to begin. She knocked up against too many people, men
and women, without counting monkeys, parrots, dogs,
cats, ponies, elephants; it all ended by getting mixed up
in her head, like the theaters and the towns. She grew
quite bewildered, among so many different things. She
had seen everything and done everything. Once, during
a week when she was &#8220;resting,&#8221; she had helped her landlady,
who kept a public-house, to draw the beer and had
waited on the customers, with her fifty-pound diamond
brooch at her throat.</p>
<p>At a benefit performance, one night, when they were
drinking champagne on the stage, actors, singers, artistes,
all together, her pink tights had excited the dress-coats.
Lily had been &#8220;pressed in company,&#8221; that is to say, surrounded
till she did not know which way to turn, while
her time was pretty well taken up with saying, &#8220;Paws
off!&#8221; before, behind, on every side. She had triumphed
at galas, above a tumult of heads and parasols: at Roundhay
Park, among other places, beneath the motto, &#8220;Let
Leeds flourish!&#8221; Feeling anxious about her future, she
had consulted a &#8220;Zanzig&#8221; at Earl&#8217;s Court. Each week
brought its surprises, its fresh knowledge. Lily learned
something every day: &#8220;If you see a lamb in the fields
with its head turned toward you, that&#8217;s lucky; if you see
its tail first, it&#8217;s a sign of bad luck,&#8221; and the way of
holding your hands, of placing your fingers, of whispering
certain words in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>She collected halfpennies with holes in them. In
Ireland, she had kissed the Blarney stone and picked
shamrock in the ruins. She had lost her little mother-of-pearl
hunchback in the labyrinth of underground passages
at the Blackpool Tower Circus. The loss of this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
lucky charm had damped her spirits for a week. And
her profits were small and her &#8220;exes&#8221; constantly increasing:
tips to the call-boy, who cleaned her bike; tips to the
stage-manager; half-crowns and five shillings in every
direction. As soon as she had put a trifle by, a week without
an engagement made her hard-up again. Though she
traveled at reduced fares and contented herself with a
ham sandwich or a slice of pork-pie on the road, she
would never, never be able to repay Jimmy that money:
she had not even paid Glass-Eye yet! Her dresses for on
and off the stage swallowed up everything. And yet she
couldn&#8217;t go about naked, like Lady Godiva!</p>
<p>And time passed and passed. Lily was growing <i>old</i>:
she was eighteen! There were girls of her age who were
already beyond work, used up, like that girl contortionist
who had just been cut open for a tumor; and
Lily had as yet achieved nothing! Oh, she ought to have
signed for America or Australia, or else for Russia, of
which she had heard wonders&mdash;Poland, the Parisienne,
had just returned from there covered with diamonds&mdash;theaters
that played all night and did not close till dawn,
to the clicking of champagne-glasses. Lily dreamed of
it, ecstatically: England was no good to her now. The
New Trickers, with their own cheap Lily, were working
her idea on the Bill and Boom Tour! If only she could
have the continent! They were talking of a new music-hall
which Harrasford was to open in Paris. He meant
to make a palace of it, they said, and he was also stretching
out his arm toward Antwerp, Cologne, Lyons, Marseilles,
a continental trust....</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I ought to have,&#8221; thought Lily.</p>
<p>Her present life seemed empty, notwithstanding its
excitement: it was like the sound of a band; nothing remained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
of it. Departures, constant departures from one
town to another, always leaving, never staying. But for
Glass-Eye&#8217;s company she would have cried, sometimes,
for sheer melancholy, as at the sight of those really loving
couples in the boarding-houses, on the stage itself; those
babies in the arms of their Mas; it made her heart ache;
the thought of it pursued her like the call of distant bells,
while the train rushed into the darkness.</p>

<p>There were pages and pages like this in Lily&#8217;s autograph

</td></tr></table>

<p>Since Miss Lily&#8217;s arrival in Paris, her collection had
been increased by the addition of a fervent declaration
from her friend, the architect. This had been her welcome
in Paris, the good fellow, no doubt, prophesied by
the ideal pair of legs; yes, she had hardly reached Paris
and already there were people dying of love around her,
already a man at her feet.</p>
<p>Lily was delighted to meet this sincere friend again, a
friend of her childhood, who, she said, had known her
when she was &#8220;that high&#8221;: one poor devil the more
ready to leave wife and children for her sake. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
evening before, in her dressing-room, at the Bijou Theater,
she had told him the story of her life since leaving her
parents. It made her forget to ask about Harrasford
and the new theater which he was to open: was it
ready? The architect ought to know better than anybody.
She would ask him to-night. And Lily lay turning
this over, in the morning, in bed, notwithstanding
her other cares, for she must get clear somehow, must
see the agents that afternoon. She had plenty to do
beside her turn. She had to busy herself with those thousand
and one details.... She would never have
believed that it was so hard to fill her three years&#8217; book.
Lily felt half-dead with fatigue before she started:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me sleep!&#8221; said Lily, stretching herself in the big
double bed which Glass-Eye had just left; &#8220;clear out!
Let me sleep!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Glass-Eye made a rush at Lily, tickled her in the
neck, stifled her laughter under the pillow: it was a necessity
for them in the morning, those few minutes of
horse-play, of thumps and smacks, which rang out on
every side. Lily, at last, full-throated, with fluttering
nostrils, cried out for mercy. The maid went off, Lily,
now quite awake, remained alone, and her worries returned:
no more love, no more music, as at the theater,
no more purple rays, nothing but gloomy hours, a long
day stretching out before her like a gray corridor. It
was real life now: letters to write, costumes to mend, last
night&#8217;s tights to wash in the basin.... Lily, sitting
on the edge of her bed, took her purse from where
she had hidden it under the bolster&mdash;a habit she had
acquired in marriage, because of Trampy&#8217;s nightly ferretings&mdash;and
emptied it on the sheets: one blue banknote;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
one, two, three gold coins. How much did that
make in pounds, shillings and pence? Hardly seven
pounds. It was all in vain for her to economize, like that
Ma of a star, who counted the potatoes. It was all in
vain for her to stint in every way, to keep back Glass-Eye&#8217;s
wages for over a year, saying that she would
pay her in a lump: she would have almost nothing left
after the purchases which she had to make. It was true
that, to-morrow, she would receive her fortnight&#8217;s pay;
and she hoped for a renewal. She felt sure of it, if only
because of the way in which the manager had taken her
by the chin. Then a fortnight at the Brussels Alhambra&mdash;1
November, Flora, Amsterdam&mdash;10 January, Copenhagen&mdash;and,
for the rest, her three years&#8217; book was empty
and each empty page represented months without work&mdash;all
her profits would be swallowed up by her enforced
idleness. She would never clear herself, never be able
to pay Jimmy. Oh, she was furious with him because
she could not discharge her debt to him once and for
all, fling his money in his face, show him if people remained
penniless long when they had her talent! That
idea comforted Lily. And it was important that she
should look nice to-day, to go the round of the agents.
Lily dressed quickly, cunningly puffed out her bows, a
trick she had learned as a child, and then, before putting
on her dress, cooked the food with Glass-Eye, who had
just come in with her parcels.</p>
<p>Then a dash of scent on the handkerchief, a touch of
rouge on the lips and, leaving the room all untidy, she
went out, followed by Glass-Eye, rigged out in a pair
of thread mittens and carrying the sunshade and the
wrist-bag. Quick, quick! For Lily knew by experience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
that it is well to be the first at the agent&#8217;s or else there&#8217;s
nothing for you.</p>
<p>She did not dislike those walks through the Paris
streets:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have some fun,&#8221; she said to Glass-Eye.</p>
<p>By this, Lily meant laughing at those &#8220;tiny Frenchies&#8221;;
and, if they ventured to accost her, crushing them with
a &#8220;<i>Vous hettes oun cochon</i>!&#8221; Although, among the people
she mixed with, agents, artistes, stage-hands, everybody
spoke English, Lily had not come to Paris without
learning a few words, &#8220;<i>Oui</i> ... <i>Non</i> ... <i>Vous</i>
<i>hettes oun cochon</i>!&#8221; and so on, which were indispensable,
she thought, to a girl who wanted to make herself respected
on the continent, a girl alone, especially. And
she loved to snub those damned <i>parley-voos</i> who dared
to accost ladies. It seemed to lighten those days of visits
to the agents, the very prospect of which gave her a
headache in advance, because one had to think of everything,
lithos, photographs, programs; and, if the agent
wasn&#8217;t in, ruin one&#8217;s self in correspondence; and puff
one&#8217;s self in every way, rub it into them that one was the
cleverest person on earth....</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re too modest,&#8221; said Lily, &#8220;they&#8217;ll take you at
your word!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the pay would drop, in consequence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never tell your salary!&#8221; was another of Lily&#8217;s favorite
maxims.</p>
<p>She gave out that she made heaps, that a little star like
her, the Marie Loyd of the bike, was only to be obtained
for untold gold. But, at the agent&#8217;s, she had to cut her
prices: there was no hiding anything from them; it was
like going to the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, when you&#8217;re in work, everybody wants you;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
and, when you&#8217;re out of work, they have nothing for
you: it&#8217;s help yourself as best you may!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She had to help herself now; and it was delicate business
dealing with people who have only one idea in their
heads, to swindle you, in order to curry favor with the
managers by getting them cheap turns. They would
have skinned you alive:</p>
<p>&#8220;Two pounds a week. Do you accept?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to Halifax!&#8221; Lily would reply in such cases, looking
them straight in the face. It took courage to do that:
the agent might grow bigger, become an enemy. She
didn&#8217;t care! She wasn&#8217;t going to lower her price for anybody!
And the commission she had to pay them was a
torment to Lily; calculating the percentage made her head
split&mdash;not to speak of the complicated nature of the
contracts, worse than insurance policies. The poor artiste
was bound down on every side, at the mercy of the
manager; everything was foreseen, down to the prohibition
of black tights, which concealed one&#8217;s poverty. And
it was bad enough in England; but in the Dago countries,
on the continent, it was worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you understand a word of it, Glass-Eye?&#8221; asked
Lily, explaining to her maid the tricks which the artiste
had to fight against. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how the small turns
manage,&#8221; she concluded, in the tone of a woman who
towers above all that.</p>
<p>Lily&#8217;s prettiness made the people in the street turn
round to look at her. They would gaze at her cheeky
feather, whisper, &#8220;You pretty, pretty darling!&#8221; in her
ear. Lily, secretly delighted, held herself ready to crush
the saucy rascal with a &#8220;How dare you?&#8221; like a lady
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
who knows how to appreciate a compliment, without permitting
the least familiarity. And when she approached
the agency, she insisted on Glass-Eye&#8217;s keeping by her
side, asked for things: her wrist-bag, her embroidered
handkerchief. And her way of walking in! Lily pretended
to be short-sighted, so as to see no one in the
rotten lot. She sent in her card, sat down in the waiting-room.
It reminded her of the dentist&#8217;s, with those
pale people sitting on benches; those serio-comics, all
over-fat; loud-voiced topical singers, who took the place
of the real artistes, just like the bioscopes and cinematographs!
There were also little families&mdash;small turns that
had struggled hard to learn a few tricks&mdash;nobody wanted
them, because they had no &#8220;chic&#8221; costumes, sometimes,
or no lithos....</p>
<p>Those were received like dogs: a wretched couple was
just coming out, a man and a woman, sad with a humility
accustomed to rebuffs; and the agent drove them toward
the door, with his voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Eccentric mashers? No opening for you. Call again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily got a good reception, in the agent&#8217;s room; but
there was nothing for her. And the agent saw her to
the door, with a satisfied air and a knowing wink, as
though to make the others believe ... Lily didn&#8217;t
like that kind&mdash;her short-sightedness did not prevent her
noticing it and blushing at it&mdash;but she was very pleased,
all the same, to be seen to the door, before those small
turns who were received like dogs....</p>
<p>On the pavement outside, the wretched couple came up
to her shyly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know us, Miss Lily? The Para-Paras.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had to listen to a pitiful tale. She heard nothing
but that, when she went on her rounds of visits to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
agents. Oh, the distress which she beheld there! It
made Lily feel quite ill at night. A little more and she
would have said her prayers, before
getting into bed, to thank
God that she hadn&#8217;t come to
that. Poor Paras! Starving,
no doubt, remaining for weeks
in their garret, pretending that
they had been performing in the
provinces ... abroad....
Lily pictured them passing the
stage-doorkeepers to whom they
had sold their parrots and being
greeted with a &#8220;What&#8217;s for
breakfast, Polly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Lily,&#8221; they confessed,
in a whisper, &#8220;you know such a
lot of people: if ever you hear
of anything for us, never mind
where ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor beggars!&#8221; thought
Lily.</p>
<p>And her Ma had prophesied
to her that, one day, she
would be worse off
than they! No, she
would never be half
so badly off! Why,
she could have had
anything she wanted,
motor-cars, Paris
gowns, for the asking.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Glass-Eye, my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
bag!&#8221; And, handing a small gold coin to the wretched
couple, &#8220;There ... between artistes, you know
... give it back when you can; good-by. Did you
notice, Glass-Eye,&#8221; asked Lily, as she walked away, &#8220;how
flattered they were when I said, &#8216;Between artistes?&#8217; They
looked quite touched.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was no time to waste in nonsense, on a day
when she was calling on the agents. The thing was to
get there first; and Lily consulted her addresses....</p>
<p>She was exasperated at being obliged, with her talent,
to climb all those stairs, to hang about in the waiting-room,
she, Lily Clifton! And it reeked of vice, stunk
with the trashy scent of the &#8220;not-up-to-muches:&#8221; merely
to look at them suggested faces seen in Piccadilly at
night or in the Burlington Arcade.</p>
<p>Lily sent in her card, threw a short-sighted glance
around her and remained standing, like a lady who is
never kept waiting and who is sure to be received at once.
And, with her head bent down and her chin in her gold-spotted
tie, she turned over the pages of <i>Le Courrier des
Cafés Concerts</i> on the table ... names which she
didn&#8217;t know ... the small &#8220;numbers&#8221; of the continent
... so much the better ... all the more
chance for her. But the engagement which she dreamed
of did not offer this time either. What the agent did
propose to her, almost without lowering his voice, with
the door open, before everybody, was the grated private
boxes of South America ... the private rooms of
Russia ... accompanied, at a startled movement on
Lily&#8217;s part, by this concession:</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t sleep there, you know!&#8221;</p>
<p>To talk like that to a lady! Lily felt stifled. Was
that what she had learned the bike for? To exhibit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
herself after the show, at the customers&#8217; disposal? Lily
could have fainted on the stairs, as she went down.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of those!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Not I!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she continued her weary pilgrimage of stairs,
from agent to agent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have six months filled up in my book before to-night!&#8221;
she said, determined to visit them all, small and
large, rather than go back empty-handed.</p>
<p>There were some who suggested to her that ten per
cent. was really very little....</p>
<p>&#8220;I like their style!&#8221; thought Lily. &#8220;They want an
extra sop thrown to them: one might as well work for
nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p>She thanked them, nevertheless, so as not to make
enemies of them&mdash;one never knows&mdash;and the agent
doesn&#8217;t matter so much; but the assistant, who happens
to have known you when you were &#8220;that high&#8221; ...
better give him a tip, lest he should round on you.</p>
<p>She also saw a former artiste, a friend of Pa&#8217;s, who
had become an agent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Lily? Lily Clifton? What are you doing now?
Won&#8217;t you see my secretary? Leave your address with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellows whom Pa helped!&#8221; she grumbled angrily, as
she went down the stairs. &#8220;They&#8217;re the worst of all!
They make you pay for the humiliation of their own failure
on the stage!&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently, she came to an agent who practised almost
in the street, in an arcade somewhat like the Burlington,
an agent for everything ... circus, music-hall, theater
... artistes formed in a week ... white
flesh at famine salaries. There were all sorts of people
there, a moving heap of frayed velvet and shabby plush.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
Lily passed by with great dignity. Next, she came to
the big agent, with offices in Berlin and London ...
the ting-ting of telephones, the tick-tack of typewriters
all day ... business pure and simple, an exchange
for supple loins, swelling biceps, muslin skirts, pigeon&#8217;s
eggs ... a sheaf of stars who, from there, radiated
over Australia, America, England, the Eastern and
Western Trusts, Bill and Boom, Harrasford, the continent.
Lily felt a little ill at ease as she entered&mdash;she
had a pain in the pit of her stomach, as when she used
to expect a smacking&mdash;and again in the private office
crammed with papers and registers, when alone with the
agent, who looked at her card, he seated, she standing.
Then, suddenly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily? Miss Lily? Your price is two hundred francs
a week, I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;With a bike and a maid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what you had at Maidstone, so I was told.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a lie!&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;Three hundred francs is the
lowest I&#8217;ve ever had. I&#8217;ll show you my contracts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t trouble,&#8221; said the agent. &#8220;I thought ...
we can get plenty at that price, you know ... in
your style....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In my style, perhaps ... but not me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh, the audience doesn&#8217;t know the difference.&#8221; And
he started looking through a register, turning over the
pages and repeating mechanically, like a refrain or a
lullaby, &#8220;The audience doesn&#8217;t care a hang; it&#8217;s all the
same to the audience.&#8221; And, suddenly, with his hand
flat on the open book and the other ready to take up the
pen, with a piercing eye fixed upon Lily, &#8220;I can give you
a month at a thousand francs ... they want a girl
in tights ... at Lisbon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lisbon?&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;That&#8217;s at the Colosseo. A
thousand francs to go to the Colosseo, with one&#8217;s luggage
and a maid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; broke in the agent. &#8220;And what do you want
a maid for, you extravagant little beast? Why not your
maid&#8217;s family while you&#8217;re about it? A thousand francs:
will you take it? I&#8217;ve got some one who will, if you
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily had to say yes or no quickly. Her forehead was
wrinkled with the effort of turning the francs into shillings,
the shillings into pounds. She consulted her book,
like an artiste who doesn&#8217;t know, who may not be free,
for a whole month. She lowered her chin in her tie, but
without smiling ... had a cramp in her stomach,
rather ... at a pinch, by leaving Glass-Eye in
Paris.... After Lisbon, one generally had Madrid
and Barcelona and returned by Marseilles and Lyons.
Friends of hers had done well like that. But to accept
a lower salary once meant accepting it always, in establishments
of the same class; it meant reducing her price,
for always, by two pounds a week, at least.</p>
<p>&#8220;A thousand francs: will you have it?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s impossible! I can&#8217;t take less than twelve
pounds a week.&#8221; And she began to sum up her proofs:
&#8220;Look here, at the Hippodrome, Glasgow ... at the
Palace, Leeds....&#8221;</p>
<p>But the agent wouldn&#8217;t listen, shut up the register, was
sorry:</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t do it ... bad season ... cyclists to
be had for the asking. Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily went out, went down the stairs, feeling half-inclined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
to go back and accept; but no! Lower her
prices? Never! Oh, those cheap artistes, those black-legs
deserved to be hanged! Great lazybones who learn
a few baby tricks on the bike or the tight-rope, back-shop
acrobats, slop-shop Lilies, who practise at a safe
distance, by watching you on the stage, through an
opera-glass. They cut your prices by half; they would
work for a handful of rice, like a monkey. They deserved
to have the iron curtain come down on them, and
flatten them out like black-beetles, the wind-bags!</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Glass-Eye, perhaps it&#8217;s they who fell into the
orchestra, was it, when I got my thighs full of lamp-glass
from the footlights, eh? They copy you, think
themselves artistes.... What! Yes? You say
they are, Glass-Eye? Damn it, I&#8217;ll have your eye out!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily had a fit of laughing when she saw Glass-Eye,
who hadn&#8217;t said a word, raise her elbow in affright
to ward off the blow.</p>
<p>Lily held the banister with one hand, leaned on Maud&#8217;s
shoulder with the other and laughed and laughed, only
to see her maid&#8217;s terrified face, a regular fat freak shrinking
before the belt. My! She would have fallen with
laughing, if Glass-Eye had not held her up; she plugged
her lips with her scented handkerchief, slapped her thighs.
She had never laughed so much in her life. She already
felt consoled for all her bothers:</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch me, Glass-Eye! This is the way to go down-stairs!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, nimbly as a bird, Lily hopped on the banister,
with her back to the wall, and&mdash;w-w-w-w-whew!&mdash;slid
down to the bottom, keeping her balance faultlessly,
sprang to her feet on the last stair and, with a wave of the
hand, as after a successful trick:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There! What do you think of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily was not given to long spells of sadness. Reaction
always followed immediately upon her worries, made the
thousand and one vexations of a day like this easier for
her to bear. The compliments which caught her ear in
the street comforted her too:</p>
<p>&#8220;You pretty, pretty ...&#8221;</p>
<p>But she had no time to listen. Six months in her book
before night! As time passed, Lily would have been
content with less. And trot, trot, trot: while she was at
it; then she would end by seeing whether they would
get her for a handful of rice.</p>
<p>This idea amused her. Lily had confidence in her talent
and continued her visits. She saw them all: other
agents, former bosses or profs, who had sucked apprentices
dry to the marrow and who continued their evil
practices in their offices; this sort sized you up with
the eye of a slave-dealer. There was also the lucky agent,
who had started a sensational attraction, a Laurence or a
Light of Asia. This agent had a touch of pride about him,
with his eternal, &#8220;I gave her her first start!&#8221; as though
to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll never find another like her, never! They don&#8217;t
turn them out like that now!&#8221;</p>
<p>And all this was a pretext for offering you ridiculous
terms, because you were neither Light of Asia nor
Laurence. It was no use Lily&#8217;s boasting of having declined
Bill and Boom and Harrasford, pretending to be
an artiste for whom the managers were competing
against one another with sheaves of banknotes. There
was nothing for her at this one&#8217;s ... nothing for
her at the others&#8217;, either ... only a scrap of news
of her family, through an artiste. The New Trickers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
were all the rage in Scotland, it seemed; an engagement
in London, at the Palace, was waiting for them. When
Lily heard that, she turned pale with envy: so it was
on their account that she had been refused that tour in
England, so that they might have it! Patience! Her</p>

LILY<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>day would come ... when she returned from the
continent and, instead of Miss, called herself Mlle., like
Adeline Genée and lots of others! Meanwhile, she had
found nothing. Still, Lily knew that one sometimes
had whole months of enforced idleness, without knowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
the reason, and then, suddenly, one&#8217;s luck returned.
One only has to wait a bit, thought Lily, making herself
very short-sighted as she passed before the arcade,
the haunt of the out-at-elbow pros and of the piffling
little agents, the jackals of the profession, on the lookout
for a bone to gnaw. And it was not a little vexing
to hear her name pass from mouth to mouth&mdash;&#8220;Mrs.
Trampy, Mrs. Trampy&#8221;&mdash;and who could be drawing attention
to her in that rotten lot? Was Trampy there, by
any chance, pointing his finger at her? She felt inclined
to go back to them, to tell them in two words what she
thought of them. Mrs. Trampy, indeed! It was not for
long, in any case. Her divorce was not far off!</p>
<p>In the evening, at the theater, she forgot her bothers,
as usual. The day, for that matter, was quite an ordinary
one: it was the typical day, the trot, trot, trot, of
the star alone, in search of engagements. And, thoroughly
tired, in her dressing-room, she related in her
own way the adventures which she had had since the
morning, the compliments on her beauty; and at the
agents&#8217;, my! If she had liked, she could have filled up
her three years&#8217; book! The architect came in her dressing-room
for a moment: so interesting a Lily! so amusing,
he thought, as funny, in her way, as Light of Asia,
the Chinese girl without arms. Sitting on the big trunk,
he admired by turns Lily and the disorderly dressing-table,
its cracked looking-glass, scribbled over with
names, and, under the glaring light, the grease-paints&mdash;red,
white, black&mdash;the powder-puffs and hare&#8217;s feet,
the biscuits in the tray among the hair-pins, a bottle
and glasses beside the powder-box. From nails on the
whitewashed walls, scratched all over with inscriptions,
covered with penciled dates, hung rainbow skirts, bodices
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
with metallic flowers. The bike shone in a corner, half-buried
under Lily&#8217;s outdoor clothes. Tights hung beside
it, like pink skins, gold spangles strewed the uncarpeted
floor and scent hovered over everything.... Half-open
doors admitted gusts of music from the orchestra;
and Lily, opposite the glass, fumbled among her pots with
the tip of her finger, stained her lips blood-red, fixed the
rebellious curl to her forehead with a touch of gum. Outside,
in the passage, was the row of doors, with spy-holes
and visiting cards, half-sheets of paper, stuck down
with wafers and bearing the names of the various occupants:</p>
<p>&#8220;Prof. X. The Famous X. Family. Absolutely the
best.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were others &#8220;absolutely the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Lily&#8217;s door, her card&mdash;&#8220;Miss Lily&#8221;&mdash;and, under
that, modestly:</p>
<p>&#8220;And maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily revived amid these surroundings; here she forgot
her fatigue, blossomed out to her heart&#8217;s delight. With
her rainbow dress, her feathers and her pearl pendants,
combined with her elaborate gestures as she made up
her face in front of the gollywog, she resembled the officiating
priestess of a strange religion, pacifying some
angry-eyed idol to the sound of distant choirs.</p>
<p>While finishing her make-up, Lily continued her stories,
talked of her successes in England and here and there
and everywhere ... and the lord who wanted to
marry her and rained down presents upon her: fifty-pound
brooches, diamonds.... Everybody in love
with her: to listen to her you could have followed her
traces like the passage of a cyclone ... men gone
mad ... others blinded through weeping ...
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
millionaires ruined in chocolates and sweets ... and
flowers, my!</p>
<p>&#8220;You could fill the Colosseum with them, couldn&#8217;t you,
Glass-Eye? I&#8217;ve been spoiled everywhere,&#8221; continued
Lily, &#8220;and I&#8217;m known everywhere! Even in Paris, to-day,
there were a lot of ladies and gentlemen under an
arcade and you heard nothing but &#8216;Miss Lily, Miss Lily,&#8217;
didn&#8217;t you, Glass-Eye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Lily.&#8221;</p>
<p>But these social successes did not make Lily forget her
business affairs. Harrasford&#8217;s new music-hall worried
her: if she could only play there, only snatch it from the
New Trickers! For they would certainly try to get there;
and the architect, of course, knew ...</p>
<p>But Lily was interrupted by the call-boy: time for her
to go down to the stage!</p>
<p>A hurricane came up from the orchestra, muffled, with
beats of the big drum, like distant cannon. The curtain
would go up soon; it was the time when Lily stretched her
legs, before giving her performance, and took a breath of
air in the painted forest. A click of the padlock and:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Glass-Eye, the bike!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily, in spite of her brilliant successes in England, was
dead tired of tipping the boys; it ran away with all her
money. As she allowed herself the luxury of a maid, by
Gollywog, she might as well make use of her; she wasn&#8217;t
going to feed her to do nothing! And poor Glass-Eye
attended to the bike, at the risk of putting out her other
eye. Every day the struggle between Glass-Eye and the
bike formed the joy and the delight of the passage.
There were incredible swervings, scratchings of the wall,
barkings of Glass-Eye&#8217;s shins. Lily followed behind,
bursting with laughter, warning Glass-Eye to take care
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
or she would put the bike out of gear by knocking it
about with her legs:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, where&#8217;s my belt?&#8221; she cried, patting the back of
her hand.</p>
<p>The artistes, attracted by the noise, half-opened the
doors; laughing eyes gleamed at the spy-holes; voices
cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Go it! Never say die!&#8221;</p>
<p>Glass-Eye perspired like anything, pursed her eyebrows
above her fat, red cheeks, grumbled, in her Whitechapel
slang:</p>
<p>&#8220;Kim up, you lousy moke! Igher up, Jerusalem, you
pig-headed bag of tricks!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily lost patience, snatched the machine from her, ran
it down the stairs, pushed the door of the &#8220;meat-tray,&#8221;
and found herself behind the scenes, the drops rising and
falling, the nightly spectacle since she had been &#8220;that
high,&#8221; the land of the unreal lights. And the sudden glare
from the reflectors set clusters of shoulders blazing with a
silvery glow, brought up out of the shade the pale flesh
of the dancing-girls, heaped up behind the pillars. It
swarmed from every side, right and left&mdash;&#8220;Hi, there!
Meat, meat!&#8221;&mdash;under the rush of the stage-hands shifting
the wings. There were fleecy foams of fair wigs,
smiles from kiss-me-quick lips, blinkings of made-up
eyelids, a swarm of arms, thighs and necks, preparatory
to a ballet, <i>Heures d&#8217;amour</i>, in which Poland, the Parisienne,
triumphed with her costumes <i>Déshabillé gallant,
Dessous diaphanes, Le tub, Volupté, Dodo</i>, eight pantomimic
scenes in a sumptuous setting, with girls to impersonate
the Hours, from pale-pink flirtation to scarlet
desire.</p>
<p>Lily watched this familiar sight with a wandering eye;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
and suddenly she turned pale: what was that? Who was
that? In the midst of it all, smiling to her from a distance,
as though laughing at her, stood Trampy! My!</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, hold my bike, Glass-Eye!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was close on her turn, but, before going on, she had
a word to say to the stage-manager and, walking up to
him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see that josser looking at me?&#8221; said Lily,
pointing to Trampy. &#8220;If he stays here, I ... to
begin with, I shan&#8217;t go on. I won&#8217;t be humbugged by any
one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, darling,&#8221; said the stage-manager and, suddenly,
between the scene which was being hoisted up and
the other let down on the silent, empty stage: &#8220;You
there! Get out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Trampy could not believe that the words were meant
for him. He waited until the order had been twice repeated.
He, an artiste, before those girls! He made a
gesture as though to ask:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you! No jossers here,&#8221; said the stage-manager.
&#8220;Sling your hook!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; thought Lily, when he had gone. &#8220;This time
you&#8217;ve been paid back in your own coin! So you kicked
me out at the Horse Shoe, did you? It&#8217;s my turn now,
you damned tramp!&#8221;</p>
<p>She exulted with delight, as she went through her performance.
It was her first revenge! the other&#8217;s turn
would come next.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t forgive and I don&#8217;t forget,&#8221; she muttered to
herself. &#8220;Every dog has his day.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>Oh, how happy she was! She was magnificent on the
stage, under the flashing lights, and the dull sounds in
the orchestra were to her as the throbbing of a riotous
heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Trampy, you got soaked to-night, to-night,&#8221;
thought Lily, as she might have said, &#8220;One, two!&#8221; to
mark her times. &#8220;To-night, to-night. And, if you don&#8217;t
like it&mdash;one, two&mdash;you&#8217;ve only got to lump it! Divorce
was made for men and women, not for dogs!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily was triumphant, laughed, winked her eye, as she
rode past, at the stage-manager, who threw her a kiss
and grinned. Immediately after her turn, she ran to
her dressing-room, poured water on her steaming skin,
while the make-up trickled in pink streaks down her face,
and devoted an hour to the dainty care of her person,
like a cat licking itself. And then Lily, without paint
or powder&mdash;awfully ugly, not in the least pretty off the
stage, as she said, smiling in her muslin tie with the gold
spots&mdash;Lily went out by the front, to avoid the pros&#8217; corridor.</p>
<p>The moment she was in the lobby, she assumed the air
of a lady accompanied by her maid. She cast an indifferent
eye at the string of carriages, like one who changes
her mind and prefers to walk, a smile to the gentlemen
at the <i>contrôle</i>, a nod to the Roofers going out, two by
two, always, a dark one and a fair one. Lily stopped for
a second, to look round....</p>
<p>Then: &#8220;Let&#8217;s go home, Glass-Eye!&#8221;</p>
<p>She took a few steps along the street, but a jolly voice
behind her cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, what a spanking walk!&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned round; it was Trampy again!</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, this time,&#8221; thought Lily, &#8220;I shall have witnesses!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>She expected blows! She would have given anything
to be struck: her divorce, at last, would be hastened on!
Cruelty, public insults! But no:</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s my dear little wife?&#8221; asked Trampy, with outstretched
hand.</p>
<p>Lily was so greatly surprised that it took her some
seconds to recover her presence of mind; and then, without
turning her head:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come away, Glass-Eye,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are drunkards
about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let us quarrel, little wifie. Aren&#8217;t you my dear
little wifie? Well, then....&#8221;</p>
<p>And Trampy took her by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go, or I&#8217;ll break your jaw,&#8221; muttered Lily,
under her breath.</p>
<p>Trampy seemed in a jovial mood, with his cigar in his
mouth, his cheeks flushed with insolence, his eyes moist
with libations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make peace,&#8221; said Trampy. &#8220;Peace in the home:
that&#8217;s my motto!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Divorce!&#8221; cried Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peace in the home for me!&#8221; rejoined Trampy, who
grew the more radiant as Lily grew more and more incensed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me tell you,&#8221; he continued, puffing luxuriously
at his cigar, &#8220;that divorce&mdash;why, how can you think of
it?&mdash;means a public scandal, my name dragged in the
mud....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Footy rotter!&#8221; roared Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dragged in the mud; and my dear little wife left to
her own resources, marrying again, as she feels inclined,
marrying some one unworthy of her, perhaps. I won&#8217;t
have it! I&#8217;m responsible for you! I&#8217;m your natural
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
protector! You&#8217;re not Miss Lily, you&#8217;re Mrs. Trampy.
You&#8217;ve been in the wrong, certainly; you had me turned
off the stage, me, your husband; but I forgive you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I ... take that!&#8221; Lily broke in, spitting in
his face. &#8220;That&#8217;s how <i>I</i> forgive <i>you</i>! Take that! And
that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Trampy reveled with delight:</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> my dear little wifie, aren&#8217;t you? And you&#8217;ll
remain so ... and you&#8217;ll never belong to any one
else, do you hear? I am a faithful husband. You&#8217;re trying
for a divorce, I know, but you won&#8217;t get it. The
wrong is on your side and I&#8217;m not going to law, and
you&#8217;re Mrs. Trampy and Mrs. Trampy you&#8217;ll remain!
Will you come and have a drink, Mrs. Trampy?&#8221; he continued,
lighting a fresh cigar. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you? Very well.
Good night, wifie!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Trampy, turning his back to her, disappeared in a
cloud of smoke.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>Lily came home and went straight to bed, without
even waiting for supper, so great was her hurry to forget.
It seemed to her that things had happened, things
without end; that this day had been as long as a year.
She simply could not understand Trampy. She could
have imagined anything, except that! She racked her
brain to conjecture how, why; and sleep quieted her till
the next morning; and she woke up with teeth clenched
and eyebrows set and ... why? Why? And again
why? Did he still want to keep her?&mdash;after realizing in
a hundred different ways that she did not love him, that
she loathed him, that she had married him only to escape
her whippings and that she had but one idea in her head:
to divorce him!</p>
<p>Now&mdash;only Lily could not know this&mdash;it was because
of that very reason that Trampy clung to her, like a
faithful husband: Jimmy, Jimmy was his bugbear. He
believed Jimmy to be in love with his wife. Once Lily
was divorced, Jimmy could marry her; and Trampy
would see him further first! The greater Jimmy became,
the more jealous Trampy grew. He knew the
steps Lily had taken to obtain a divorce, the witnesses
she had tried to secure. She was very keen on a divorce,
was she? All the more reason for not gratifying
her; and she wasn&#8217;t going to get it. The witnesses,
Trampy had just heard, declined to give evidence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
They had seen nothing, heard nothing. A bike at her
head? Maybe. They didn&#8217;t know. A bit of a fuss between
artistes, such as you see every day, and none of
their damned business. Outside that, Lily had nothing
to go upon; on the contrary. She had abandoned the
conjugal home; all the wrong, apparently, was on her
side. He, Trampy, alone was entitled to file a petition;
but that never! He considered that Jimmy and Lily had
trifled with him sufficiently. He could not swallow the
idea that they were only waiting for the divorce to get
married; the idea that Lily would be Mrs. Jimmy, of her
own free choice, after marrying him, Trampy, to escape
her whippings; no, he couldn&#8217;t swallow that! Now it
rested entirely with him to prevent that marriage. He
had only to keep his dear little wife for himself. In that
case, Jimmy, if he wanted her, would be obliged to do
without her or else to &#8220;live with her&#8221; and set a bad example,
lavish bestower of good advice that he was, the
dirty hypocrite, preaching morality to others! That was
what Trampy had determined to do. As for Lily,
Trampy, who was incapable, at bottom, of either hatred
or love, didn&#8217;t care one way or the other. He was always
sure to want for nothing, so long as there were girls on
the boards and whisky in the bars.</p>
<p>There was another reason still that urged him to let
matters rest, without going further. To embark on a
divorce-case, to have his name in the papers and his story
hawked round the four quarters of the globe&mdash;&#8220;Trampy,
you know. You knew Trampy, didn&#8217;t you? The husband
of Lily?&#8221; and so on&mdash;was what he didn&#8217;t want at any
price, for a reason known to himself. He had made inquiries,
quite privately, at the beginning, when he thought
of petitioning for a divorce; and what he had learned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
had made him prudent: his marriage in America was
valid beyond a doubt. He was well and duly married,
whether he liked it or not. By the common law, two
wives meant bigamy; and bigamy meant prison, which
was the last thing he wanted, as he himself said. But,
so long as there was no scandal, he ran no great risk.
He had lived on tenter-hooks at first, in Germany.
Chance might have brought him face to face with Ave
Maria, on the stage of a music-hall. This danger was
not to be feared now, so far as he knew. Ave Maria
and her brother Martello were no longer fit stars for
Europe, nor for North America. He was too well known
to the agencies; his brutality had produced too many
complaints, too many denunciations to the police; it discredited
any theater employing him. He might have
come to Europe&mdash;who knew?&mdash;to try to get hold of the
Bambinis, now that the old man had not much longer to
live. But that was not very likely, either. An artiste,
come across by accident, had seen the pair at Iquique, in
a wretched circus that was doing the coast of Chili. He
gave Trampy details: poor Ave Maria had grown very
ugly; a body all skin and bone and nerves; no hips, no
chest; nothing of the woman about her; in the last stages
of consumption; and finished, as an artiste, done for;
no spring left in her overworked thighs, no suppleness
in her loins: even her brother, that brute, could get
nothing out of her now. And Trampy, who knew Chili,
followed them, in his mind, on their tour along the coast,
from Iquique to Copiapó, to Valdivia: a trying climate,
biting winds which would kill her on the spot, unless
she went and perished in the fever-stricken plains of the
Argentine.... When people had fallen so low as that,
they did not rise again: there was nothing to fear from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
that side. But her presence was not necessary; the
danger still existed. There were documents, in black
and white. Their names were bracketed on a register
somewhere or other: he knew where. It was better,
therefore, in every way, not to call attention to himself.
Meanwhile, he was playing a nice trick on Lily and her
Jimmy. And Lily was Mrs. Trampy and Mrs. Trampy
she would remain; and that was all there was about it.</p>
<p>But it was no use for Lily to give herself a headache
trying to make out why and how. She did not guess
Trampy&#8217;s secret thoughts, any more than he suspected
the actual nature of her relations with Jimmy. For her,
too, one thing was certain: Mrs. Trampy she was and
Mrs. Trampy she would remain! She would never be
free; she would always be chained to that tramp cyclist!
And, if a match should happen to turn up for her among
her admirers, the architect, for instance&mdash;you can never
tell: plenty of others had already proposed for her hand in
marriage, in England&mdash;she would be obliged to refuse!
And, if some gentleman were to pay her his addresses,
treat her like a lady, take her to choose a hat or a silk
petticoat in a smart shop, there was somebody who would
have the right to say to her, as she passed:</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s my little wife getting on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, those two Jim Crows round her, spoiling her
future! Jimmy and Trampy! They would end by being
the death of her. Oh, if she had had Thea&#8217;s arm, what a
blow in the jaw for one or both of them! And Lily, when
she thought of it, wore the face which was hers on her
bad days, teeth clenched, stubborn forehead. Glass-Eye
shook in her boots when she saw it, for sometimes Lily
vented her anger upon the poor girl with a smack, considering
herself quits if she begged pardon after!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s one of those footy rotters,&#8221; growled Lily, hearing
a knock at the door, &#8220;smash a bottle over his head!&#8221;</p>
<p>But no, it was simply her letters, sent on from the
theater. Nothing of importance this morning; prospectuses,
mostly: a wig-maker, special theatrical department;
a manufacturer of traveling-hampers, for South
Africa, Australia....</p>
<p>&#8220;No use for them,&#8221; thought Lily, with a sigh.</p>

A ROOFER GIRL<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>And, on opening <i>The Era</i>, she received that discouraging
sensation: always so many names, and so many tricks,
and all &#8220;the best;&#8221; new ideas and troupes, troupes,
troupes; another new troupe of fat freaks, a very flood of
them; and Roofers, Roofers; &#8220;Greater-Greater England
Girls,&#8221; words and music guaranteed, with scarlet legs and
muslin skirts, complete; page upon page of pink tights;
and national troupes and colonial troupes; and one had to
earn a livelihood and shine among all that! Lily was half
crushed; and everybody she
knew was triumphing: the
Pawnees,&mdash;one hundred
and thirty music-halls, the
whole of the Eastern and
Western Trusts, the great
two-years&#8217; tour! The Three
Graces also were continuing
their triumphs. Lily,
who felt herself the equal
of any of them, held her
breath as she read the
news. Laurence had won
her terrible bet that she
would ride straight across
Manchester and Salford on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
her bike, hands tied together, feet fastened to the pedals.
At the Art Institute in Chicago, Marjutti had given a
lecture on the art of contortion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some josser of a journalist wrote it for her,&#8221; thought
Lily.</p>
<p>And <i>The Performer Annual</i> had sent Marjutti its set
of questions to answer, she had been published in print!
And Lily was still waiting! And Tom? Tom was in
England now, in the De Frece circuit; had had a triumph
at the Portsmouth Hippodrome, as &#8220;Topsy Turvy Tommy,&#8221;
dancing a sailor&#8217;s hornpipe on his hands. All, all
were successful, including others even who were not so
good as she was: one who obtained engagements because
she had a nigger in her show; another because of a
monkey.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve done nothing yet!&#8221; grumbled Lily.</p>
<p>Oh, to be talked about in her turn, to achieve something,
to become &#8220;our Lily!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s twelve o&#8217;clock and I&#8217;m still in bed!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;I ought to be practising!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was just a flash of pride, mixed with remorse.
She knew it well enough; often and often, she had reproached
herself for her idleness, for her habit of sleeping
till the middle of the day, of taking her meals before
the performance; but she would make up for it to-morrow!
It is the usual refrain of stars who have become
detached from their troupes, far removed from regimental
discipline, so to speak: without a Pa, without a
boss, you can do nothing. You must have some one to
force you.</p>
<p>&#8220;A month on the three years&#8217; book before to-night!&#8221;
prayed Lily, touching her lucky charm.</p>
<p>And she studied the omens with an expert air, gave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
an ear to passing sounds, tried to catch the meaning of
them, for she had visits to pay, letters to write, business,
damn it!</p>
<p>That was what Pa used to say before her. And it
was not so easy to turn a letter prettily: that was Trampy&#8217;s
forte. She knew something about it. Lily, in her
night-dress, with her elbows on the table, bit her pen,
reflected, in a mental effort that gave her a headache.
And that note-paper wasn&#8217;t nice, either, without a heading;
true, it only rested with herself; every day she was
approached with offers of artistic photographs, even of
tricks which she did not do: standing with one foot on
the saddle, the other in the air and her arms stretched
out before her, like a flying genius; or as Cupid, with
his dart in his hand: impossible things which neither the
Pawnees nor Laurence would have dared to attempt!
But it would look well, with her name in red letters:
&#8220;Miss Lily,&#8221; or &#8220;La Belle Lily.&#8221; Or else a photograph
showing her strolling in a great park, with a palace in the
background, taken from nature, followed by her maid,
or by a footman, hired by the hour, for the occasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I shall select the governess,&#8221; said Lily to
herself, &#8220;because of my biography; it will be nicer, truer.
Or I might be taken riding on the back-wheel, like a lady
just leaving the house and doing that to amuse herself?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily, still undecided, took up the pen again: one foot
on the saddle; six pairs of tights; three dresses; the
theaters at which she had appeared....</p>
<p>What a pack of jossers! She couldn&#8217;t forgive the
agents for her present want of success. She was exasperated.
She felt inclined to go and see the managers
themselves, those who had made love to her on the stage,
and to send in her card to them&mdash;&#8220;Miss Lily&#8221;&mdash;just to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
teach those jossers of agents! Her independent ways
had already made enemies for her: she knew that; but
how could she help being angry? The tricks they played
you, down to making you miss a marriage, as had happened
in London, the other day, to the Three Graces, to
one of them, who had been courted, during Mr. Fuchs&#8217;
absence, by the boy-violinist. Their agent had launched
into slanders and even insults to prevent the marriage,
which would have split up the troupe and broken the
contract....</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pack of nigger-drivers!&#8221; thought Lily. &#8220;As
long as they get their ten per cent., the rest can go hang,
for all they care!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Lily had got out of bed on
the wrong side, at the thought of having to climb all
those staircases again and to dance attendance with the
rotten lot in the waiting-rooms. But, by Jove, she could
have boxed the ears of the first agent she visited that
afternoon! He had the impudence to offer her a magnificent
engagement in the Indian show at Earl&#8217;s Court,
she to stain her skin brown, dye her hair black, with
rings in her nose, at the wrists, at her ankles; a costume
like Miss Ruth&#8217;s, all in gauze; the nautch-girl on the
bicycle; six times a day, in the open air, to the sound of
tomtoms. Play the negress; that&#8217;s what he offered her!
She could not help laughing, in spite of her anger. But
she became quite intractable and snubbed another agent
who suggested a one day&#8217;s billet in a tiny music-hall at a
ridiculous price.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t give my performance under five pounds, or
on a stage of less than thirty feet!&#8221; cried Lily.</p>
<p>At last, luck seemed to turn; she settled for Spain and
Portugal, and that same evening, at the Bijou Theater,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
she was offered another engagement, for three months
hence. This contract would procure her others, after
her spell of ill luck. Lily at once took courage again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if I had the Astrarium!&#8221; she thought.</p>
<p>Everywhere, at the theater, at the agents, people were
talking of the new music-hall. It even became a current
joke. They said, &#8220;So-and-So&#8217;s performing at the Astrarium,&#8221;
as though to say, &#8220;He&#8217;s not performing! He&#8217;s
living in a castle in the air!&#8221; Every one was talking of
the great music-hall which was to open in a few months
and which was not to be seen building anywhere. Some
said that it was serious; they quoted engagements: Tom;
the Three Graces; the impersonator; nothing but turns
quite unknown to Paris; novelties, nothing but novelties:
Marjutti; Laurence, perhaps; or the New Trickers. Lily
shivered when she heard that!... She opened wide
eyes, like Alice in Wonderland. Oh, to appear there!
But she had performed in Paris. Then she would change
her name; bike mixed with dancing; and her whole trick
done backward, as Pa had once advised Trampy to do in
Mexico! Oh, if she could have that! Lily Godiva, undressed
on the bike! She&#8217;d show them she was a lady,
not a performing dog! The Astrarium, that was certain,
would open in Paris in a few months. Harrasford had
said so himself. There was no doubt about it. They
even told the name of the stage-manager, Joe Brooks, the
cleverest of all. Lily felt herself carried away with ambition.
Oh! to open there! Oh, if it were true! God
grant that it might come true! Oh, if Daisy, their star,
could only break a leg! The few days which Lily was
still to remain in Paris, before leaving for Spain, she
employed in obtaining further information. She learned
the most exact particulars. Incredible though it seemed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
the Astrarium was to open quite shortly! The blue-chins
discussed the thing, amid clouds of tobacco smoke, in the
bars, after the show. To allude to it now was not like
talking of castles in the air; on the contrary. To tease a
pal, one said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re opening at the Astrarium, aren&#8217;t you? I <i>don&#8217;t</i>
think!&#8221;</p>
<p>Which was another way of saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Astrarium&#8217;s no place for you! They&#8217;re taking
nothing but bill-toppers there!&#8221;</p>
<p>The new music-hall, even before it came into existence,
was beginning to spread, like the story of the whippings;
it would be talked about, all round the world, as something
stunning, a more complete show than the Tivoli at Sidney
or the New York Hippodrome. Harrasford was credited
with designs for a palace in onyx and marble. He
had bought or was going to buy a theater with the object
of transforming it; names and prices were given. Everybody
was interested in it. Just now, especially, when
the bioscopes and the gramophones and the singers were
taking the bread out of the &#8220;artistes&#8217;&#8221; mouths, it meant
twenty turns more to receive princely salaries there;
and, every month, that galaxy of stars, which Harrasford
would send shooting to Paris, was to disperse
toward Brussels, Antwerp, Marseilles, Hamburg: the
European Trust, the Moss and Stoll tour of the continent,
managed by Harrasford, the great English manager.</p>
<p>To open at the Astrarium meant having work insured
and your three years&#8217; book filled for ever so long; meant
appearing in public, later, wearing on your chest the
medal which they meant to distribute in memory of the
opening. Gee, Lily had a pain in her side at the thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
of it! The Three Graces, it was said, were on the program.
Lily would have consulted them&mdash;there was no
jealousy about the Graces&mdash;but they were not yet in Paris.
Oh, Lily was longing and dying to be settled! Who was
Harrasford&#8217;s agent? If she had to go to London to see
him, she would go.</p>
<p>Why, damn it, she would go to Heaven itself to get
the Astrarium! Anything, anything to open there! That
dream of greatness made her endure her present vexations.
Mrs. Trampy ... Mrs. Trampy ... She
was addressed as Mrs. Trampy everywhere. Trampy
must be telling the story, taking his revenge for the whippings,
making little of her in his turn. One night even,
the night before her departure for Spain, when the architect
was to wait for her at the door of the theater, Lily,
who had dressed herself in her best, once more had the
humiliation of being accosted by Trampy in front of
everybody.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, wifie! How are you, darling? All right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily bristled with rage as she left Paris. Even when
she was far away, she still felt that she was dragging
a chain which lengthened out endlessly without breaking.
Never, oh, nothing could ever get her out of that! Yes,
a brilliant triumph. Then, at least, she could crush him
from the height of her success, that footy rotter with his
red-hot stove! Oh, what a grudge she bore him! Jimmy
was different: that was a wound of her own and nobody
would ever know; but Trampy, who laughed at her everywhere
and called himself her husband! He would make
her lose all her friends. To say nothing of the fact that
those tales perhaps counted for much in her failure: they
were repeated from mouth to mouth. Oh, her profession
disgusted her at times! And to think that she, an English
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
girl, was going to earn her bread among the Dagoes,
instead of starring in England!</p>
<p>Her wandering life continued; her journeys from town
to town, in the Spanish provinces, her arrival in the chill
of the morning, her anxiety about her salary, the hustle
and bustle of departure and&mdash;trot, trot, trot!&mdash;lugged
about in the railway-carriage, like a performing dog in
his box.</p>
<p>And what theaters! It was worse than Germany or
even Paris. In England, on the Harrasford tour or the
Bill and Boom, they had nice dressing-rooms, with a carpet,
water hot and cold, quick attendance, stairs swept
every day. Here, old plaster and those idiots who looked
as if they understood nothing&mdash;it took three of them to
shift a scene&mdash;Dagoes who asked her straight out, in
Pidgin-English, if she was alone:</p>
<p>&#8220;No man viz you?&#8221;</p>
<p>It touched her on the raw. Lily lost all her cheerfulness:
to begin with, that engagement was not a particularly
brilliant one; it was not at all calculated to prompt
her to do better, to introduce novelties into her turn.
Besides, on stages not yet overrun with Roofers or fat
freaks, an artiste performing by herself made an impression.
Her old tricks sufficed; sometimes she topped the
bill:</p>
<p>&#8220;Theaters are the same everywhere; artistes the same
everywhere, from New York to Bilbao. Topping the
bill in one means topping the bill in the others ...
doesn&#8217;t it, Glass-Eye?&#8221;</p>
<p>But she knew quite well that it didn&#8217;t; and, besides,
that satisfaction of her vanity put no money in her pocket.
The amount she owed, my! She thought of the past, of
what she had earned for &#8220;them&#8221; since Mexico. If she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
had only had half of it, a quarter, a quarter of a quarter,
damn it!</p>
<p>Meantime, she had to make herself respected. In those
countries, where people used gestures when they spoke to
you, a lady could not be too careful. Why, the men
treated an English girl just as they treated their own
women. She could have flung her bike at their heads!
And they kept it up all night, as in Russia, all except the
jewels; you had to stay till morning and were expected to
accept invitations for supper, so as to keep the customer
there and push business! A little more and she would
have had to sleep there! She had threatened to tear up
her contract, to complain to the consul. And what annoyed
her also was being in the same dressing-room with
singers who undressed without shame, while receiving
their friends, and made eyes at Lily worse than the impersonator.</p>
<p>And she had to have her food at the theater, no dessert,
nothing but a biscuit or an apple; and, if she asked
for a pear, it caused a terrible to-do. Rather than stand
that, Lily went to the hotel, which put her to double expense,
for the board at the theater was compulsory. She
had to pay in any case; so that she went away without a
farthing, thinking herself very lucky if the manager did
not try to kiss her in his office. Oh, the things she saw,
the things she rubbed shoulders with, the vice, the promiscuity,
the rushes of girls in the passages before the
onslaughts of footy rotters, direct propositions, with eyes
looking straight into eyes, brief wooings on the stairs,
behind the properties, between people just about to take
the train, one east, the other west, and in a hurry to have
done with it; a silent embrace in the dressing-room, a
neigh, a kiss; and <i>au revoir</i>, ta-ta!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>And the conversations between the stage-girls, who
were always surrounded by legends of the white slave-trade;
stories of disappearances; of &#8220;engagements for
Caracas&#8221; and finding one&#8217;s self over there without resources,
stranded in a bad house: like that poor girl, a
Roofer, who had received a letter and some sweets in her
slipper, which she had sent flying into the audience with a
high kick&mdash;Lily remembered&mdash;well, she had disappeared
in South America, somewhere; one or two despairing letters
and then silence. And that other one, at Alexandria,
who had called out for help, behind her green blinds;
and ever and ever so many others, whom she had known
slightly. Lily shivered: brrrrrr!</p>
<p>She was sick to death of it. She had had enough of it,
was fed up with it. She aspired to better things. Lily
had hoped that her engagement in Spain would have
marked the end of her bad luck; but no, nothing offered.
She was sour, bitter, fierce; a wild bull, a stallion, as Ma
used to say. And she became especially terrible now, when
her energy was spent in neither work nor love, so much
so that there was a cross against her name in the agents&#8217;
books.</p>
<p>Oh, she had often felt inclined to send them all to the
devil: the made-up eyes, the kiss-me-quick lips, the tow
wigs, the low jokes, the monkey-claws! There were some
who had merit, no doubt, like that boy who was all over
scratches, from head to foot, through training cats; but
the rest, almost all of them, were a pack of good-for-nothings
who copied their betters: amateurs, jossers all;
and they had more work than she, who had taken such
pains and who had made a fortune for her Pa. Oh, if
that wasn&#8217;t enough to make her chuck everything and see
life, in her turn. She had only to choose ...
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>These reflections came to her more particularly when
she returned to Paris, after Brussels and Copenhagen, and
was again performing at the Bijou Theater, where she
had already appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make all that money,&#8221; thought Lily, when she saw
Poland again, &#8220;and never to have been through the mill!&#8221;</p>
<p>She admired Poland for that, envied her good manners,
her grace, the way she slipped on her dressing-wrap
in the living picture, <i>The Bath</i>. She turned green
with jealousy at the sight of Poland&#8217;s motor-car, her thousand-pound
ear-rings, her sable furs. It was not that Lily
lacked admirers or sympathizers. She even had a little
triumph at the Bijou Theater, one day when she passed
round the hat for old Martello, who was ill in bed and
penniless. Lily topped the bill in her own fashion, by
putting her name at the head of the list, and the collection
was a success, everybody contributed ... including
the architect, who was still prowling round her, in
the passages, on the stage, everywhere. Lily was decidedly
courted: the rich bookmaker who ran the theater
as his private harem, he, too, patted her cheek in a funny
way, complimented her on her firm, round hips before
the group of dancing-girls packed like poultry, in the
shadow of the pillars. Gee, it only rested with herself
to have as much of that as Poland! And everything
reeked with love, amid the cannonade of the big drums
and the clash of the cymbals, while the sudden flashes
of the reflectors, moonlight-blue on one side, bright-red
on the other, lit up all around her the herd of the languid
Hours. But her heart swelled and puffed with pride.
No, no, not that! She would succeed by her talent,
damn it, not by getting round men! She, an English
girl; she, Pa&#8217;s daughter; she, who had gone through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
mill, to sell herself like cat&#8217;s meat! Never! And her
Ma should beg her pardon on her knees, on her knees,
damn it! The thought infuriated her.</p>
<p>She was quite sincere with herself. It was all her fault.
She ought to have worked and practised, practised every
day, improved and improved her turn; but she would do
so now, to-morrow. It was her last chance. She had
hardly any money left; her three years&#8217; book was virgin
once again, unsoiled by contracts; but she had a stage to
practise on and she was going to practise to-morrow even
if she had to pay somebody to run after her, with the belt,
if need be! Lily had nothing but that in her head now:
to get out of her present life, to get out of the mud, to
reach the summit at a bound. Was it possible? She
consulted the Zanzigs; she spent a fortune in penny-in-the-slot
machines to learn the future, but always received
the same reply:</p>
<p>&#8220;You will marry the man who loves you. You will be
very happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled with pity when she read that nonsense; to
prophesy her marriage: how silly! She was only too much
married! That was not what she wanted to know; but
the Astrarium! the Astrarium! Would she be there or
would she not? The New Trickers were plotting to
get there, with a turn which she had given them, goose
that she was; and Cousin Daisy, that farthing dip, would
triumph and not she, a star, a real one! Lily was rather
in the position of Pa, when he arrived in London from
New York ... with this difference, that Pa had
money and Lily had none. But there was the same display
of energy, once her pride was aroused. Lily also had run
round Paris like a mad thing: not to the agents!&mdash;with
them it was: &#8220;Lily? Lily Clifton? nothing your way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
to-day!&#8221;&mdash;but to her friends and acquaintances, to find
out about the Astrarium. Lily grew crazy at the idea
that she might perform there, be there at the opening,
ride over all of them, treat the New Trickers like so
many fat freaks!</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, God, if it were true!&#8221; she cried, with her hand
on her lucky charm. &#8220;God above grant that it may come
true!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was at the end of her tether. Nothing short of the
Astrarium could set her on her legs again. She had no
choice; it was either that or an absolute come-down: the
nautch-girl on the bike, at Earl&#8217;s Court, or else nights of
dissipation, champagne and diamonds, like Poland; and
Lily, like her Pa in the old days, clenched her fists and
gnawed her lip as she went off to the Three Graces, who
had their engagement and who would be able to give her
some hints.</p>
<p>Lily knew their hotel by reputation. Nothing but pros;
a rallying-point of troupes, an hotel where nobody&#8217;s skin
was free from bruises and where, from morning until
night, you heard the clatter of the clog-dancers&#8217; heels.
It reeked of potatoes, of sleepers three in a bed; chests,
strange-shaped packing-cases, ticketed with distant
labels, made the yard look like the stage-entrance of a
music-hall. Lily did not care for that sort of place: no
matter; besides, the Bambinis were there and their mad
rushes, their yells of mirth filled the gloomy house with
gaiety. And Lily did not mind walking in with her gold-tasseled
hat on. All those heads at the windows: it was
just like a fine lady visiting the poor. And yet she was
not proud now. Formerly, she would have laughed on
learning the kind of life led by the Three Graces, those
three girls who remained good so as not to break up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
troupe and annoy Nunkie and who were said to spend
their spare time in sewing and cooking and doing Sandow
exercises and measuring one another round the
biceps and the chest: simple joys, the only true ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;They may be right, after all,&#8221; thought Lily, who envied
them from the bottom of her heart for having the
Astrarium. &#8220;If I had only practised too! Practising is
certainly better
than attaching
all that importance
to dresses
or sending those
puff photographs
to the agents!&#8221;</p>
<p>A surprise
awaited Lily
when she entered
the hotel; pros
were talking with
a mysterious air.
There was muttering
in the corners,
a piece of
news was going
round: the Bijou
Theater had
closed, that very
day; the treasury
was empty, bankrupt; everything sealed up; just on the
eve of pay-day too!</p>

<p>&#8220;My! Is it possible?&#8221; thought Lily, distracted and
forgetting the Astrarium and the Three Graces. &#8220;And
what am I to do for food to-morrow? Come, quick,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
Glass-Eye!&#8221; she whispered, catching her a thump in the
ribs. &#8220;To the theater, quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>For Lily knew by experience that it was a good thing
to be first. Her Pa had saved his salary once, in a similar
case, at Perth, in Australia; but one must arrive in time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>There was a crowd in front of the Bijou when she arrived.
They were commenting on a notice pasted on the
door:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Fermé</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>What could that mean? Lily had not provided for this
in her vocabulary of the French language; but the theater
was closed until new arrangements could be made.
It meant complete ruin, enforced idleness....</p>
<p>&#8220;The rotten lot!&#8221; growled Lily. &#8220;Money, damn it,
money! Pay up, you pack of thieves!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Lily soon recovered herself, when she saw that
there was nothing to be done. She had been through
worse than that, when the iron curtain all but smashed her
to a jelly, at Milwaukee, and when she tumbled into the
orchestra, at Glasgow! Notwithstanding the anguish that
wrung her inside and heralded the coming hunger, Lily
put a good face on the matter before all those people,
like a lady who is above that sort of thing: a disappointment,
that was all.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how will those small artistes manage?&#8221; she
seemed to say. &#8220;Those families with babies?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily declared that it was very sad, called Glass-Eye to
witness, as usual; but poor Glass-Eye remained dumb,
reflected that she would never, never be paid, if this went
on. Lily owed her eighteen months&#8217; wages now! True,
she got enough to eat, or nearly; she traveled with Lily;
and she wore her old hats.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the door opened; the artistes were allowed
to take away the implements of their work, before the
final closing. The move began: they fetched out basket
trunks, hoisted packing-cases on to cabs. It was a heartrending
sight, all those things, made for the glitter of the
footlights, now displayed in the street. And everybody
made such haste as he could, under the eyes of the inquisitive
passers-by, for fear of a general execution, with
every door sealed up and days to wait before one could
recover one&#8217;s property. Fellow-artistes from other theaters
came to look on. Some were indignant that the
Artistes&#8217; Federation could not take up the matter and
hurl the experience of its lawyers at the heads of the
proprietor or syndicate responsible, to say nothing of
the moral weight of its five thousand members, who had
already made the English music-halls come to terms by
means of a wholesale strike. Others observed that it
was a private theater, one of those theaters run, for the
fun of it, by some prosperous gambler or lucky bookmaker;
a sort of harem theater, with almost empty
houses, but with swells on the stage, among the swarm
of half-naked women; and no one responsible, the old boy
ruined, the treasury empty, bankruptcy; couldn&#8217;t be
helped; take in your belt a peg, that&#8217;s all!</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of this, eh, Lily?&#8221; asked a voice.
&#8220;Only yesterday we were passing the hat for others!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily still had the list; and the money was locked up in
one of the dressing-rooms. Then it passed from mouth
to mouth, like a watchword: they would give back the
collection; but not in the street, not before everybody,
for the honor of the profession. Lily, quite excited, entered
the passage and there, in the dim light, assisted by
two one-legged artistes, who called out the amounts and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
ticked off the names, she handed back the collection of
the previous day. Some received their share with an air
of furious determination; others looked shy and blushed;
others, again, refused, Lily among them; and it was decided
to go to the &#8220;Pros&#8217; Corner,&#8221; or artistes&#8217; bar, near
the stage entrance, to drink up what remained: the ups
and downs of life, damn it! Your turn to-day, mine to-morrow;
jolly lucky not to break a leg, after all! And
their gaiety returned, amid the smoke and the glasses,
through a need of reaction; and, after the first drink or
two, came jokes, after-dinner stories, impromptus which
had traveled ten times round the world and brought tears
of laughter to the eyes of the audiences in thousands of
music-halls, not to speak of the second-class cabins of
every ship of every line and the smoking-carriages of
every train, from the G. I. P. R. of Bombay to the S. F.
of Buenos Ayres.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>And they joined in the chorus and they sang, &#8220;We all
came into this world with nothing!&#8221; and the one-legged
artistes beat time with their crutches, my! the pink Hour
and the scarlet Hour, who were there, got a stitch in
their sides. Lily, with her head flung back, full-throated,
laughed nervously. Besides, as she said, artistes did as
they pleased and didn&#8217;t care a hang for anybody! All
made plans for the morrow, all had been through that
sort of thing before and much worse, too: six stories
cleared at a bound, to escape from a theater in flames!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
Falls of seventy feet on one&#8217;s head! And wrecks! And
waves miles high! Already they began to talk of going
away, of traveling; traced the route with their finger
on the table: Cape Town, Australia, the States. To
listen to them, those everlasting wanderers seemed to
have pretty nearly the whole world under their hands.
They spoke of taking a rest at their permanent addresses:
good old London; good old Manchester; there was nothing
like good old England, after all, eh? They&#8217;d had
enough of the Dago countries!</p>
<p>But enthusiasm broke out when the great news arrived,
brought by some one straight from the agencies: Harrasford&mdash;&#8220;Guess,
boys!&#8221;&mdash;Harrasford had bought the
Bijou Theater! It was all signed and sealed. He was
carrying out his program: and he wanted to open at once.
For three months, it appeared, there had been a silent
struggle between him and the unlucky bookmaker, who
did not want to sell; and Harrasford had got it almost
for nothing; he had practically won it, yesterday, at the
races,&mdash;with Dare Devil, his wonderful horse. Dare
Devil had beaten Cataplasm, his rival&#8217;s colt, and the
smash had followed at once: the Bijou closed; a forced
sale; Harrasford had bagged it; and that was one, with
more to come!</p>
<p>The artistes were carried away by this daring stroke!
Harrasford, a son of a gun, who could put them all in
his pocket! The one-legged artistes fought a mock duel
between France and England, the victor to marry Lily:
what did they think of that? Hurrah!</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, boys, which is the quickest way of dropping
money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fast women!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, slow horses!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>It was grand. They drank to everybody&#8217;s health. They
drank to Harrasford; they drank to the Astrarium! They
counted the money on the bar-counter; the amount of
the collection had been greatly exceeded and somebody
suggested that it was a nice thing, upon my word, yes,
a very nice thing, what they were doing: having a good
time, while the Bambinis, perhaps, were going to bed
without any supper! The whiskies and sodas had warmed
their hearts: my turn to-day, yours to-morrow, damn it!
It might happen to any of them, to hop the twig and
leave Bambinis behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily, the hat!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily handed round the hat again and collected
more than on the day before, even among those who had
had their money back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take that to the Bambinis,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been
behaving like Dagoes, damn it! Artistes ought not to act
as such!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;K you! &#8217;K you!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily Clifton walked off, very proudly, with her
maid, to hand the money to Nunkie, who was acting as
treasurer.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, meantime, one&#8217;s got to live,&#8221; said Lily to herself,
when she was outside.</p>
<p>After the spurious gaiety of the moment, she seemed to
be returning to her distress, with no work, no money, the
Bijou closed, Harrasford taking possession of the theater.
She revolved all this in her head, without succeeding in
connecting the whole: rags of ideas hung in her brain,
like the strips of scenery at the back of the stage.
She had not even the courage to go and take her bike
... to-morrow ... to-morrow. The Hours, the
pink one and the scarlet one, who came out of the bar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
also, resigned themselves gaily. Their salary mattered so
little. As they explained to Lily, you&#8217;re always well paid,
when you have rich friends, and, if you haven&#8217;t, all you
have to do is to look out for them:</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Poland, what! A fat lot she cares the old boy&#8217;s
ruined! All she will do is to find another, change her
owner!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily had knocked up against everything, seen everything,
heard everything, in her adventurous life; but this
way of getting out of a difficulty always made her blush
to her eyes. No, a triumph at the Astrarium: that was the
only solution for her, Lily Clifton! She was eager also
to hand the money to Nunkie. The Bambinis&#8217; money was
a different matter from Jimmy&#8217;s: they were hungry children.
Nunkie must be at the theater now, with his Three
Graces, quite close, and they were going to perform at the
Astrarium. So it was not essential never to have appeared
in Paris! That meant one more chance for her!</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Glass-Eye!&#8221;</p>
<p>They now passed into the noisy quarters. The Olympia
opened its furnace of light before them. The Three
Graces stood displayed in life-size on posters, with others
beside them, names which Lily knew vaguely, as she
knew them all, from seeing them somewhere,&mdash;as she
knew the stage-entrance of the Olympia, by instinct, in
the dark street, at the side: the mouth by which the monster
nightly swallowed and rejected its fill of meat. A
courtyard ... three steps up ... turn to the
right ... Lily was at home again, amid rainbow
lights.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Lily!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Nunkie greeting her on the stage, while his dear
girls were dressing in their room. He took the money for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
the Bambinis, congratulated Lily on the result of her collection,
thanked her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about the Astrarium?&#8221; asked Lily. &#8220;Do
you know...?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, Nunkie
knew. His dear
girls were engaged
to perform there.
And he had seen
some one on his way
to the theater: the
opening would take
place in a month
... in six weeks
at the latest....</p>
<p>The architect&mdash;&#8220;You
know, Lily?&#8221;
said Nunkie&mdash;the architect
who used to
hang about on the
stage, in the passages,
on some pretext or
other&mdash;to make love
to girls, apparently&mdash;was
minding everything
for Harrasford!
He was taking
measurements, drawing out plans:</p>
<div class='figleft'>
<img src='images/illus-pg288.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 267px; height: 368px;' /><br />
<p class='captionc' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 267px;'>
THE ARCHITECT<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Everything is ready in advance, everything&#8217;s ordered;
they&#8217;ve only got to put things in their places; the workmen
will start to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s what he came for!&#8221; thought Lily angrily.
&#8220;The damned <i>parley-voo</i>!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And your Pa, you know,&#8221; continued Nunkie, &#8220;will be
there too, with his New Trickers: it would have been
easy for you to get there first,&#8221; he added, with a meaning
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;The New Trickers! Daisy Woolly-legs!&#8221; stammered
Lily, turning pale. &#8220;Who told you so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it, I had it from Jimmy himself,&#8221; replied
Nunkie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy told you? And what has Jimmy to do with
it?&#8221; asked Lily, anguish-stricken.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has he to do with it? Why, he&#8217;s simply going
to top the bill,&#8221; said Nunkie. &#8220;And, besides, Harrasford
has left it to him to make out the program. Why, didn&#8217;t
you know?... Your friend Jimmy...?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was in the street once more, feeling weak-kneed
and light-headed. She leaned on Glass-Eye&#8217;s arm; she
had a pain in her side from the emotion. She felt inclined
to enter a café, to get drunk on champagne, to forget.</p>
<p>The next day an awful headache made her keep her
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; she said to Glass-Eye, &#8220;to-morrow I
will fetch my bike.&#8221;</p>
<p>She dared not go out; she felt as if it was written on
her forehead:</p>
<p>&#8220;The New Trickers at the Astrarium! Daisy Woolly-legs
at the Astrarium and not you!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, &#8220;to-morrow,&#8221; again she spent the day stretched
on her bed. And the next day, well, as she had to ...
as her bike was her bread-winner, after all ... her
only bread-winner, whatever happened!...</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Glass-Eye! Let&#8217;s go for the bike! I don&#8217;t
care if I do play the darky at Earl&#8217;s Court!&#8221;</p>
<p>But, on reaching the Bijou, she could not restrain a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
cry. Nunkie had spoken the truth; they were at work
everywhere, unloading joists, running up scaffoldings, attacking
the theater from every side. Her friend, the
architect, passed, looking very busy, greeted her with a
&#8220;Hullo, Lily!&#8221; But Lily did not even see him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope our things are still in the dressing-room.
Hurry up, Glass-Eye!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily ran along the passage, where already sacks
of plaster had taken the place of the velvet and nickel
properties. She crossed the stage, which was still untouched,
took the dressing-room corridor and there, almost
before her door, met Jimmy! She felt like turning
her back on him, after spitting on the floor, as a mark
of contempt; but, after all, no! The coward! They&#8217;d
see which of them should lower eyes first! And she
planted hers straight in his face, like a blow of the fist!</p>
<p>Jimmy, who was coming toward her, had a moment of
hesitation ... but it did not last. He soon recovered
himself. It would have been obvious to any one seeing that
masterful face that here was a man cured of his love, a
strong man and sure of himself, a man whom a kid like
Lily&mdash;Lily had always remained a kid to him, and not
Mrs. Trampy, not the wife of Trampy, that thief in the
night!&mdash;a man whom a kid like Lily could not have at
her beck and call. And he held out his hand, like a good
friend, simply, among artistes:</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Lily? Delighted to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glass-Eye,&#8221; said Lily, opening the door of her dressing-room,
&#8220;Glass-Eye, my bag ... the key of my
trunk ... get out the bike first. One can&#8217;t turn in
this rotten hole,&#8221; she added, as she entered.</p>
<p>And, as Glass-Eye seemed all day releasing the bike
from the hooked-up skirts and tights hanging from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
wall, to say nothing of the kicks which she received from
the pedals, Lily, grumbling, snatched it out of her hands,
and ordered her maid to go and wait for her in the street,
great good-for-nothing that she was!</p>
<p>&#8220;So you refuse to speak to me?&#8221; asked Jimmy.</p>
<p>Lily lowered her head, took no more notice of him than
if he had not been there, collected her clothes, pulled the
gollywog from the wall without the slightest regard,
heaped up everything promiscuously in the trunk, thumping
it down with her fists, as though eager to have done
with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Lily, are you still angry with me?&#8221; asked
Jimmy, quite at a loss. &#8220;When you took me by surprise
that day, at Whitcomb Mansions ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot I care for your love!&#8221; growled Lily contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;But my friendship, Lily ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friendship,&#8221; said Lily, &#8220;your friendship ...
a rag! I&#8217;ll show you how I value your friendship!&#8221; she
said, flinging a dirty towel on the floor and stamping on it
in her rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that Daisy Woolly-legs!&#8221; resumed Lily, with an
unspeakable expression of scorn on her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Jimmy, who did not understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Giving that shop to the New Trickers!&#8221; she continued
violently. &#8220;You who always used to talk of my talent!
Giving a shop like that to those New Trickers, who
haven&#8217;t as much talent among the six of them as I have
in my little finger!... You! To treat me like that!...
When I think,&#8221; cried Lily, beside herself, &#8220;when
I think that Pa and Ma will be here ... with tricks
stolen from me! footy rotter that you are!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>Jimmy understood that the engagement of the New
Trickers exasperated Lily: a question of outraged pride,
of professional jealousy. He tried to explain: she had
already performed in Paris and Harrasford insisted on
that. He, Jimmy, wasn&#8217;t altogether the master. The New
Trickers were very clever, very original, very new ...</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m only fit to throw to the dogs, eh?&#8221; cried Lily
furiously. &#8220;And that rot about having performed in
Paris. The Graces have performed in Paris and they&#8217;re
to be at the Astrarium and why not I? Because you&#8217;re
my friend, perhaps. Such a friend! When it would
have been so easy for you to give me that pleasure. But
no one will ever do anything to please me! Yes, strangers,
gentlemen in the front boxes; but not friends like
you! You always bore me a grudge for marrying
Trampy.... And who knows what people say of
me behind my back!... that I cut my turn ...
that I do less than I might. You know what I can do,
damn it! But it&#8217;s work I want, do you hear, work! I&#8217;m
not what you think!... One of those ... not
I! I&#8217;d rather chew glass than take any of that!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily spoke with nervous movements of the shoulder
and fiery glances and she forced Jimmy to lower his
eyes and she told him what she thought of him straight
out, told him all her heaped-up, rankling spite, told him
all she had at heart, in words round and solid enough to
build a tower of Babel on!</p>
<p>&#8220;And I would have given my life, yes, given my life
to perform here! However, it&#8217;s done now, isn&#8217;t it? And
it can&#8217;t be undone,&#8221; said Lily, more calmly, and two
tears sprang to her eyelids.... Then, while Jimmy,
plunged in his own thoughts, watched her without speaking
and listened to her like a judge, &#8220;You&#8217;ve nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
to say to me, eh?&#8221; she continued, closing her trunk with
a thump of the fist. &#8220;Nor I either. Then help me to
carry down my hamper: you haven&#8217;t helped me to get
into the Astrarium; at least you can help me to get out
of it. No? You refuse? And you so generous!&#8221; she
said, with a scornful laugh. &#8220;Well, then, help me take
it on my shoulders. No? Not even that? Then I must
try by myself ... and never mind if I do get crushed!
<i>That&#8217;s</i> all I care for my life now!&#8221; added Lily, snapping
her fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Lily,&#8221; said Jimmy, taking up the hamper.
&#8220;You&#8217;re going out of your sense; you know that ...&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy could find nothing to say. He was pained to the
bottom of his heart ... for the grief which he was
causing her. The tone of feverish banter which Lily was
adopting upset him more than her anger had done. He
felt himself filled with pity for that poor little creature
standing at bay.</p>
<p>With a turn of the hip, Jimmy jerked to his shoulder
the great basket trunk which contained all Lily&#8217;s fortune.
It was not very heavy: tights, spangled skirts, faded
flowers. And, in the passage down-stairs, the astounded
stage-doorkeeper saw the famous bill-topper submissively
carrying the trunk of the bicyclist, who walked in
front of him, wheeling her machine beside her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>The fortnight that followed upon this meeting was
such a strenuous one for Jimmy, with eighteen hours out
of the twenty-four spent at the Astrarium, among the
day and night gangs; his life was such a slavery that he
had hardly time to think of Lily. But he did think of her,
for all that. He seemed to hear her still. Yes, he confessed
to himself, he had, perhaps, believed ... he
had, in fact, been told that Lily was Lily no longer ...
But he had just been admiring her magnificent anger.
He had seen her eaten up with ambition, quivering from
head to foot, and that brave face lifted up to his. Twenty
times over he was on the point of saying something to
her; but he must see first ... Would she herself be
willing? Even though she had seemed resolved to do anything?</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile,&#8221; thought Jimmy, as on the former occasion,
when she was ill, in Berlin, &#8220;how are we to help
her out of this ... how?&#8221;</p>
<p>And he was caught in the whirlwind again: it was
Jimmy here, Jimmy there. He had to be in ten places at
once. Not that he was manager or stage-manager: his
was a special case. Since his return from America, Jimmy
possessed an even more thorough knowledge of all the
machinery of the theater. He had his memorandum-books
filled with notes, his head crammed with new ideas. He
had a smattering of everything, a vast amount of experience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
picked up in rushing about the world. After
his triumphs with &#8220;Bridging the Abyss,&#8221; the managers,
knowing that he had prepared something different, something
strange and terrible, without knowing exactly what,
the managers had bombarded him with offers: Chicago,
Berlin, London. A conversation with Harrasford, whom
the Astrarium held body and soul, had determined the
matter otherwise: he would open the Astrarium with
Jimmy and remodel the theater from top to bottom in
view of the new trick, the most sensational that had ever
been seen. And Jimmy should make the necessary alterations,
he should have a free hand.</p>
<p>Jimmy accepted. To open in a theater made for himself
seemed preferable to Jimmy to launching his new
invention in a closed hall, such as the London Hippodrome,
for instance, which did not provide the aperture
in the roof, the door opening on to the stars, which he
required to obtain his effect upon the crowd. And that
was why, in the work at the Astrarium, everything
turned upon Jimmy. He was responsible to both Harrasford
and himself. For that matter, he was fully equal
to the interests at stake. Harrasford, a great judge of
men, intrusted everything to Jimmy, the sensational bill-topper,
removed above all jealousy; and he left it to his
experience to construct the program. Harrasford himself,
the chief and master, rarely left London; he managed
all his theaters from his office, with the &#8217;phone at
his ear, or else flew like the wind in every direction, buying
a theater here, picking up a star there, on the wing.
It was not until the third week that he came to see for
himself how the work was doing and to discuss the
accounts. His broad back was seen, followed by Jimmy,
to plunge down the plastery corridors, to pass under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>scaffoldings. He looked like a conqueror, tracing with
his finger the plan of the palace that was to rise upon the
ruins of the destroyed city; or else he would point out
things with a jerk of the chin:</p>
<p>&#8220;The proscenium pushed forward to here, eh, Jimmy?
A cluster of electric lights here. Another there. And
what about your trick, Jimmy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must imagine the house in darkness,&#8221; said
Jimmy, &#8220;and blue and green rays falling on the stage
from above. Through the blue, we send a great dazzling
beam, from over there, lighting up every inch of the
house, a terrific light, the light of the Last Judgment....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Harrasford. &#8220;We want two or three fits
of hysterics at the opening, real ones, not hired at two
bob a night,&#8221; he added, with a wink. &#8220;They&#8217;re working,
up there,&#8221; he continued, a piece of old plastering falling
on his shoulder, as they crossed the floor of the house,
denuded of its seats.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the opening in the roof,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;I should
have liked to show you ... the staircase is blocked
with scaffoldings ...&#8221;</p>
<p>But Harrasford, at the risk of breaking his neck, had
already grasped the rungs of a provisional ladder, made
of spokes stuck through one of the four beams which
rose from the floor to the ceiling and supported it, while
the whole of the space between them was being opened.
The architect was there when Harrasford came out on
the roof. He showed him four piers of strong masonry
which were being built against the outer walls, explained
that two T irons of considerable strength would rest with
their ends on the piers and run across the roofing from
wall to wall. Two other irons, also parallel, but running
lengthwise, would be bolted to the first two. This arrangement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
would make a horizontal frame of twenty by
thirty feet. They would then remove the beams which
supported the roof during the operations. When the
plastering was finished and the gilding applied, this
would form, as seen from below, a handsome frame to
the sky. The architect also explained how the truncated
roof would be secured to the frame, forming a whole
as firm as a rock, and how a light iron sash, completely
glazed, could be drawn along the two transverse T irons,
thus opening or closing the hall as desired.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole thing&#8217;s worked from below by electricity,&#8221;
said Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long will it take?&#8221; asked Harrasford.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all ready. It&#8217;s only got to be fixed up,&#8221; said the
architect.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how much? Give me the detailed account to-night,
at the station. I&#8217;ll study it on my way to Berlin.&#8221;
And, turning to the workmen, &#8220;<i>Faites vite! Dépêchez</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>They were the only words of French he knew, a vocabulary
no more extensive than Lily&#8217;s, but of a different
kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the lights?&#8221; asked Harrasford, before he went
down again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, there,&#8221; said Jimmy, &#8220;on steel rods, connected
by electric wires.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll dish the Berlin Winter Garden, with its stars
set in black velvet,&#8221; said Harrasford.</p>
<p>And he followed Jimmy toward the stage wall, which
stood out above the roof of the auditorium. Here some
other workmen were cutting a doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go and see the floor now.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Harrasford plunged through the door, followed
by Jimmy. They crossed the fly-galleries and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></p>
<p>made for the blocked staircases. Before they went down,
Jimmy called his attention to a pulley which was being
fixed to the ceiling and which was to carry a rope with a
stirrup for the performer&#8217;s foot, to enable him to reach
the stage in a few seconds, after doing the trick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Harrasford.</p>
<p>In half an hour, he had visited everything: the roof,
the flies, the cellar, the auditorium, the front entrance.
Workmen were hurrying everywhere. Harrasford encouraged
them with a slap on the shoulder:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Dépêchez! Faites vite</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>They were working at everything at once, from the
new installation of electric light and the steam-heating
apparatus, in the basement, to the emergency exits and
the main lobby. Upholsterers were taking measurements
in the front boxes. The sound of the hammer rang
out from top to bottom, amid a cloud of dust; men
climbed the scaffoldings, hoisted up things; and the sight
of all this activity gave the impression of a plan thought
out in advance, executed with great certainty, but incomprehensible
to any one not in the secret. There could be
no doubt but that the spectacle which was being prepared
would be of a sensational character: even the back-wall
of the stage, which was empty at that moment, had been
altered. By clearing away a few dressing-rooms, they
had raised the floor and ceiling of the huge property-entrance.
It had been closed up at the back and fitted with
a sliding door in front.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bird&#8217;s cage,&#8221; said Jimmy, with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how does he get out?&#8221; asked Harrasford.</p>
<p>&#8220;Windlasses here ... a rope up above ...
hooks,&#8221; said Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when will it be fixed?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Finished next week, everything&#8217;s ready, the trials
have been made. It will only need a little practice, here,
on the spot, calculating the effort, getting used to the
distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;House packed for six months!&#8221; said the manager.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s a cigar to your success, Jimmy! Come and let&#8217;s
have a drink at the bar; we&#8217;ll settle the program over
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later, the two entered the bar where, a fortnight
earlier, Lily had handed round the hat a second
time for old Martello and his Bambinis and where the
artistes, who had already dispersed toward the four corners
of Europe, had raised their glasses to the success of
the Astrarium. And there, in the little back room, which
was deserted by the artistes, now that the theater was
closed, but which would soon again be the intersecting
point of so many vagabond existences ... where
the nigger cake-walker from Chicago would play poker
with the equilibrist from Japan ... where the profs
and the bosses would exchange complaints about the
strictness of the regulations concerning the work of apprentices
... where little girls, worth their weight
in gold, would come, coyly, encompassed by Pas and Mas,
but with glances askance at flight; in that corner where
funny men would swallow mixed drinks and talk through
their noses; there, under the frames containing row upon
row of signed photographs of artistes: human pyramids,
girls in a knot, foaming muslins, Apollos and Venuses
all muscles; there, in Pros&#8217; Corner, Harrasford, the man
for whom all those people toiled and moiled, head down
or feet in the air, the man from whom one thousand persons
drew salaries night after night, Harrasford lit
his cigar and sat down at a table with Jimmy, over a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>bottle of beer, and, forthwith, pencil and note-book in
hand:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see the program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy, on his side, took a written list from his pocket
and laid it on the table.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the select turns which they
were about to discuss had long been engaged for Harrasford&#8217;s
different music-halls, some of them two or three
years ahead, as often happens in the case of the great
bill-toppers, and the question was to choose among the
best, so as to insure the triumph of the opening night.
For Harrasford, who had as yet appointed no one as
manager or stage-manager, the thing was to settle a program
which would discourage any attempt at competition,
to have none appearing except stars, without counting
those whom he held in reserve for the following
month, before distributing them over his variety-theaters
in England, or, later, to any part of Europe, in the &#8220;Great
Powers Tour&#8221; which he proposed to create and of which
the Astrarium would be a sort of &#8220;commodore&#8221; music-hall,
or headquarters. Jimmy only gave his opinion, after
which Harrasford would decide.</p>
<p>Harrasford&#8217;s dream was a model music-hall, something,
in its own way, like the Grand Opéra in Paris: a palatial
edifice, in a new style of architecture, with friezes displaying
bodies in contortion, caryatids, cast from life,
supporting the springers of the arches, mixed groups
of loins and chests with swelling muscles, under the
electric lights, and, in the lobbies, a lavish display of
African onyx, Scotch granite and Russian porphyry. The
crowd would pass in between Venus and Apollo, holding
flowers and lights; and there would be music everywhere;
gaiety, noise, red and gold everywhere; all cares would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
be laid aside and forgotten on entering; it would be a
hall containing every modern convenience, like the Iroquois
at Buffalo or a &#8217;Frisco sky-scraper: newspapers,
café, bars, smoking-room, barbers&#8217; saloon, telegraph-office,
telephone-office, messenger-boys, ticket-office, private
rooms in which phonographs would shout out the latest
news illustrated with telesteriography, from eight o&#8217;clock
till midnight. The idea was to create, thirty years ahead
of its time, the great popular music-hall, with its ball-rooms,
as at Blackpool, its side-shows, a palm-garden,
a roof-garden; to draw to the theater those who, on
getting up from dinner, go to the café and stay there; to
give them an atmosphere of mirth and jollity, of comforting
lights, a sort of night forum, of People&#8217;s Palace, with,
in the middle, in the sumptuous hall, facing the furnace
that was the stage, a long thrill of three hours&#8217; duration.</p>
<p>And he would realize it next year, but he was in a
hurry to open now, to plant his flag of victory:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Faites vite! Dépêchez</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dare Devil had won the place for him and Jimmy was
bringing him the sensational attraction, the inspired godsend
which would pack the Astrarium for six months
and fill its till and spread its name far and wide over
Europe.</p>
<p>Harrasford thought of this with a puff at his cigar,
after glancing at the photographs on the wall, and then,
suddenly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see the program.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but bill-toppers,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;Picked
turns from the first to the last ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which will be you,&#8221; Harrasford broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes ... I ... or somebody else ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, somebody else?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Jimmy, &#8220;to heighten the effect of my
turn ... for reasons which I&#8217;ll explain to you ...
perhaps it would be better to have a woman ... better
for the success of the attraction!&#8221; he hastened to add,
at an astonished gesture of Harrasford&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;And ... are you sure?&#8221; asked the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; said Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The program first,&#8221; said Harrasford, returning to his
notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We open with a gallery in marble and gold, something
showy and quaint, in the Potsdam style, with a
negress inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. Light of Asia, eh? The armless Chinese
girl whom I discovered at Poplar.... Music of
cymbals and triangles, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;I have something better ...
more æsthetic, less cruel ... a Soudanese woman
from Chicago. She walks on to the stage in a low-necked
dress ... a magnificent woman ... a creamy
complexion, with a touch of pink ... and golden
hair ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said a negress,&#8221; interrupted Harrasford.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait ... a splendid voice ... classical
music ... then a wild African melody....
She feels a flutter of homesickness; the perspiration
streams down her face; she presses the sponge soaked
in water, hidden beneath her wig,&mdash;and the enamel, the
white of the shoulders, the pink cheeks all trickle away
and, finally she appears black as ebony, and, to the growl
of the kettle-drums, does a disheveled dance, kicking up
her legs like a puppet on a string ... Patti-Patty
... talent and absurdity mixed ... a crazy
toy ... movement and noise, while the hall fills.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Next?&#8221; asked Harrasford.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next, without any interval,&#8221; continued Jimmy, &#8220;directly
after that performance by the court fool before his
majesty the audience, the curtain rises upon a park ...
and the New Trickers chasing one another among the
trees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The New Trickers!&#8221; said Harrasford. &#8220;Bicyclists:
that&#8217;s very stale. And, besides, what about you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has one ever,&#8221; asked Jimmy, &#8220;seen a music-hall give
two similar special turns, two bicycle turns, for instance,
in the same show?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Absurd!&#8221; said Harrasford. &#8220;Explain yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s to differentiate between my invention and trick-riding
from the very first,&#8221; replied Jimmy, &#8220;to show, once
and for all, that mine has nothing in common with the
ordinary turns you see on the stage: &#8216;Bridging the Abyss&#8217;
or &#8216;Looping the Loop.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be right,&#8221; said Harrasford, &#8220;it will prevent
confusion; yours is purely scientific. And the New
Trickers: tights? Bloomers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Skirts, all in white, Warwick style,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;A
school-girls&#8217; spree: see-saw on the bike ... somersaults
over the benches ... waltzes, lively tunes: an
impression of gaiety and happiness. The star is a statue on
a pedestal in the park. The others throw flowers to her.
She wakes; steps down: &#8216;Hullo, a bike!&#8217; And then a special
tune for the star and a waltz on the back-wheel, amid
the admiring circle of school-girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Harrasford. &#8220;And what&#8217;s the price
of the New Trickers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So much.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he jotted it down in his note-book, near the prices
of Dare Devil and Cataplasm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>Jimmy also took notes, mentioned the names of the
great serio, the great comic singer, with their figures:</p>
<p>&#8220;So much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They earn their money pretty easily, those two!&#8221;
grunted Harrasford. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to submit to it, I
suppose. Next?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy only described the spectacular turns. Harrasford
listened, saw it in his head: a corner of untamed nature,
a valley in the mountains, blue distances, sunshine
in the foreground. The Three Graces arrive all out of
breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;You understand,&#8221; said Jimmy, &#8220;they are supposed to
have been chasing the deer or hunting butterflies. As a
matter of fact, Mr. Fuchs will have made them do their
Sandow, before going on, to bring the blood to their
cheeks; he&#8217;s full of ideas, is Mr. Fuchs. On arriving,
a moment&#8217;s rest, an adorable group in all the splendor
of the nude ... sweet, solemn music ... and
then a glorious performance, a sort of human cluster
hanging from the trapezes, something healthy and robust.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Harrasford, putting a cross in his
note-book opposite the Three Graces. &#8220;And next?&#8221;</p>
<p>With Harrasford it was always &#8220;And next?&#8221; like a
man who never has more than just so many minutes to
spare, because his train&#8217;s waiting.</p>
<p>It was a curious sight to see the two talking together
in low voices, with an occasional glance at the door
when some indiscreet person looked in. They might have
been taken for a pair of conspirators plotting a move;
no one would ever have suspected that they were composing
a performance, unique of its sort, which would be
famous to-morrow. Everything was provided for:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
scenery, music, the color of the dresses, effects of light,
the alternate doses of laughter or grace or terror to be
served up to the audience; everything was discussed then
and there, in all its details, down to those two sketch-comedians,
with faces streaked red and white, against a
back-drop representing an old English street, two drunken
sports, with hats mashed in, coats turned inside out, ten
minutes of mad tricks and inhuman cries; for the audience
must have its pittance of the grotesque as well.</p>
<p>There was a herd of comic elephants, five enormous
animals in a Hindoo setting; and no master on the stage,
no boss, no prof: they all obeyed a whistle blown in the
wings. And, conducting the orchestra with an air of unspeakable
gravity, a monkey, Mozart II., a caricature of
an infant prodigy, made the huge brutes perform their
evolutions, to the Soldiers&#8217; Chorus from <i>Faust</i>. Then,
in his enthusiasm, Mozart sent his desk flying into the
air, followed by his coat, his shoes, his conductor&#8217;s baton,
and ended by seizing his tail in his hand and beating
time with that.</p>
<p>&#8220;That dishes Orpheus and Mad-darewski,&#8221; said Harrasford.
&#8220;And next?&#8221;</p>
<p>The <i>entr&#8217;acte</i> came next, with portraits and biographies
of the artistes distributed among the audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Harrasford, laughing. &#8220;Old English
families ... clergymen&#8217;s daughters....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Learned all that with their governesses, as a surprise
for their Pa and Ma!&#8221; continued Jimmy. &#8220;Mozart II., a
favorite of the king of Lahore; Patti-Patty, a descendant
of the Queen of Sheba: we&#8217;ve got to do it. There&#8217;s no
getting away from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must hide the bruises,&#8221; said Harrasford. &#8220;And
next?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Next, I hope to have the Bambinis: ten minutes of
rosy mirth; real biographical babies, born with that in
their blood, brother and sister, two marvels. I shall obtain
permission for them to appear, though they&#8217;re under
the age; the old father is dying, the famous Martello.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must engage them for my tour,&#8221; said Harrasford.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the old man doesn&#8217;t die first; in that case, there&#8217;s
a brother who will come and claim them, it seems.
They&#8217;re a fortune, the two Bambinis, to whomever secures
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One dress-coat more on the stage,&#8221; said Harrasford.
&#8220;And next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Topsy Turvy Tom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I know!&#8221; said Harrasford, laughing. &#8220;The
fellow who used to wear leaden armlets to harden his
muscles and smash Clifton&#8217;s jaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the one,&#8221; said Jimmy, laughing in his turn. &#8220;A
threat of Clifton&#8217;s, who said that he would &#8216;make him
dance the hornpipe on his hands, damn it!&#8217; suggested the
idea of a turn to him, so they say. He set to work with
superhuman energy&mdash;and now he is a bill-topper....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well done!&#8221; cried Harrasford, banging his fist on
the table. &#8220;There&#8217;s no country but old England can turn
out bulldogs like that, lads who jump from the gutter
to the top of the bill! That&#8217;s what I call a man! And
what&#8217;s his turn like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A scene of his own: the front of a palace. A pink
marble figure, naked down to the waist, supports a huge
cornice. A thunder of big drums, a flash of lime-light
and the palace splits from top to bottom. The figure
staggers, falls on its hands and gives a stupendous acrobatic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
performance: somersaults on the hands; waltzing;
treading the ball: the &#8216;hornpipe, damn it!&#8217; And then
Tom stands on his feet, all in shadow. A powerful ray
of light is thrown upon him, and you see the muscles of
the abdomen slowly moving, the pectoral muscles quivering,
the deltoids leaping and starting, the biceps swelling;
and, when he turns round, the rhomboids hollowing out,
the muscles of the back rolling: the triumph of the human
machine ... and of Tom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And of will,&#8221; said Harrasford. &#8220;How much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worth it. And next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roofers, high-kickers: the Merry Wives. We begin
with dancing and end with dancing. The puppets make
their bow to the public before being put away in their
boxes ... the curtain falls ... and good night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then you come!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I come,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;Or she.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your invention,&#8221; said Harrasford seriously, &#8220;is not a
music-hall entertainment. It is, undoubtedly, the greatest
of all scientific toys, a marvel of modern ingenuity. Do
you really want a pair of tights on the top of that? And,
first of all, where will you find the woman who will dare?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the question, obviously,&#8221; admitted Jimmy.</p>
<p>Not that Jimmy must have been in love with Lily, to
think of her! It had first just passed through his head,
no more. But, on reflecting, it had appeared to him that,
in the theater, the beauty of a Lily would add greatly to
the success of his attraction. To work his invention in
public was different from experimenting with it in his
shed in London. It was leaving the laboratory to take
its place in life; and it would be a triumph to see the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
daring trick succeed, every day, at the fixed hour, within
a restricted compass; to see it go through the opening
above; to see that machine worked by a young girl in
whom one would have suspected neither the strength
nor the nerve: it would make the public infer the excellence
of the engine. Now Jimmy was possessed, above
all, of scientific enthusiasm. His machine before everything;
not his personal triumph, his machine. He
dreamed of giving that added grace to his diagrams;
and he considered that there was no disadvantage in
allowing science to be introduced by youth and beauty.
Moreover, Jimmy was a little heavy for an apparatus in
which he had even suppressed the motor, in order to
make it more easily manageable ... a lighter body
would perhaps be better ... Lily, Lily was the
ideal operator; but was she capable of it? Jimmy had
confidence in her. Jimmy, certainly, did not allow sentiment
to mix in his affairs; there was the weight of his
responsibility to consider. But then there was also his
meeting with Lily in the dressing-room passage. And he
had understood her mental agony. He had seen the
gleam in her eyes and so great a display of energy in her
face that Jimmy had resolved to try her; and he would
judge her much better by the way in which she should
face death.</p>
<p>That is what Jimmy explained to the manager, leaving
a good deal untold, of course, and Harrasford retired behind
the smoke of his cigar, listened, approved.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your affair, when all is said and done. All you
want is success, I suppose? And will you arrange with
her ... with your ... what did you say her
name was?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many Lilies; and, if somebody has to
break his or her back, I had rather it was a Lily, one out
of the bunch, than you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily, meanwhile, was loitering outside. Harrasford
and Jimmy had no notion that the girl about whom they
were talking was quite close to them, thinking of them.
Lily had heard an artiste say that Harrasford was visiting
the Astrarium. She had come in all haste, impelled
by some vague hope. Chance would have it that
she was still in Paris. Everything, besides, seemed to
be keeping her there: an agent, the day after her interview
with Jimmy, had advised her to stay a few days
longer; there might be something important for her.
Lily could not understand in what way; however, she
had stayed, though she was almost without means of
support. She began by trying to sell her jewels, the
fifty-pound diamond, among others, which that lord had
given her in England: the jeweler handed it back to her,
saying that it might be worth eight francs! That meant
destitution. And yet hope always returned to her in one
way or another. She had even received three blue banknotes,
three hundred francs, in an envelope! Her fortnight
at the Bijou! No doubt about it, they were paying the
artistes&#8217; salaries; perhaps the Federation had taken the
matter up? Three hundred francs; not enough to pay
Glass-Eye or to give to Jimmy, but just sufficient to settle
her small debts, buy some new dresses and go to London
to play the darky at Earl&#8217;s Court. Oh, what a ridiculous
come-down! And so, when she learned that Harrasford
was at the Astrarium, she took her courage in both hands:
she would see Harrasford. She would try the fascination
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
of her smile upon him. She would be settled at
once and for ever.... When she thought of the
New Trickers, her blood seemed to stand still in her
veins: the New Trickers at the Astrarium! And Jimmy,
the mean cur, not to have got her that shop, when she
had such a splendid idea: Lady Godiva on a bike! And
a scene of her own: the front of Peeping Tom&#8217;s club,
with all the boys at the windows!</p>
<p>Just then, Harrasford came out of the bar. She hurried
up to him and introduced herself:</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Lily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which one?&#8221; said Harrasford. &#8220;Excuse me; no time
now. See Jimmy, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>And he plunged into a cab and shouted an address to
his driver.</p>
<p>Lily stood stupefied, as she watched the cab disappear.
This time it was finished, quite finished.... She
gave a last glance at the Astrarium and sighed....</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily!&#8221; It was Jimmy coming out and crossing the
street. &#8220;Hullo, Lily!&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Lily,&#8221; said Jimmy, gently and gravely. &#8220;You
wanted to get there the other day, didn&#8217;t you? You told
me you would do anything for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To take the place of the New Trickers, yes!&#8221; exclaimed
Lily. &#8220;I&#8217;d have risked my life!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The New Trickers are there,&#8221; said Jimmy, &#8220;and are
going to remain. Listen to me, what I have to propose
to you is very serious: it&#8217;s something else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else? You know that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m good for ...
to go round and round ... you know it quite well!&#8221;
cried Lily, her face drawn with impotent anger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
&#8220;I know what you can do. Look here: would you like
to be above the New Trickers? Would you like to top
the bill? Are you ready to do everything for that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May God forgive you for mocking at me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you top the bill?&#8221; asked Jimmy again, in an accent
that sent a thrill down her back. &#8220;Answer me: yes
or no?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cried Lily. &#8220;My life, everything, damn it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></p>

<p>Jimmy was greatly excited when Lily had given him
her answer and he led her to the Astrarium. To understand
his feelings fully, one would have to know his life
since the evening when, at Whitcomb Mansions, he had
looked Lily in the face and told her no. He realized
then, from the emotion which he experienced, how great
a place Lily had filled in his heart, the little passenger
from New York to Liverpool; the girl who came to see
him in his shop in Gresse Street; the Lily whom he
dreamed of &#8220;helping out of that&#8221; when he saw her
on the stage, from up in the fly-galleries; the one whom
he had tried to take away from Trampy; the poor sick
girl in Berlin; those Lilies whom he felt moving inside
him, around him, like a breath of April; all those
Lilies, he had broken with them all! Oh, it was hard!
Lily should never, never know what courage he had
needed to keep silent, he, the man she thought so cold,
nor what a tempest ... oh, if she could only have
seen into him! And then ... he had not met her
again....</p>
<p>He, after his engagement at the Hippodrome, went off
to America; Lily traveled on her part. Also, he was a
prey to his fixed idea, his great project, always: his ambition
increased, the same longing for success which, formerly,
in Gresse Street, had made him spend nights in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
study after days of toil, at the time when, under Lily&#8217;s influence,
his roaming thoughts built castles in the air, when
he felt awakening within himself his racial instinct as an
heroic seeker after profitable adventures.</p>
<p>And his ambition took great strides forward, was not
limited, as in Clifton&#8217;s case, to upsetting the fat freaks
or training New Zealanders to spin round and round.
He dreamed of a useful life, based upon his own efforts.
He wished to found his future upon a discovery of his
own, which had long haunted him and which had
ripened in Berlin, between his flights in &#8220;Bridging the
Abyss,&#8221; a thing at which he worked incessantly in Whitcomb
Mansions; and, this time, the stage prowlers,
should not steal his idea. To begin with, apart from
a few pieces of technical advice which he received from
a friend of his, an engineer, nobody knew about it;
and Jimmy felt sure that, even when the apparatus was
at work, he would not fall a victim to the confraternity
who, ever on the watch for new tricks, study them,
judge of the weak points, copy whatever suits them,
including scenery and music, and, sometimes, succeed
in earning more money than the inventor himself; he
would have nothing to fear from the Trampies, the pirates,
the plagiarists, those plagues of the profession.
Certainly, there were great bill-toppers, creators of sensations
who discovered new things&mdash;terrifying feats of
gyroscopic balancing, or flights through space, based
upon principles of ballistics, assisted by the spiral spring&mdash;daring
risk-alls, nerve-shakers, purveyors of thrills,
turning to intelligent account the seductive power which
dangerous feats exercise upon the public. Jimmy knew
all about that. He was not the only one; but, this time,
it was a question of a scientific application which would,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
beyond a doubt, place him at the head of that pick of the
music-hall. It would be pure science and patient calculation:
an algebraical hippogriff, with pluck in the saddle.</p>
<p>Jimmy&#8217;s plans resulted from intuition rather than real
knowledge; but learning has nothing to do with the creative
spirit. Now Jimmy, although he was unaware of
it, possessed the genius that invents; and his comparative
ignorance did him no great harm: his imagination,
unhampered by theories, was all the freer for it. Jimmy
had the higher instinct of the born machinist, who is content
to use a bit of string where a school-bred engineer
will cram every manner of gear, chains, pulleys and windlasses.
It is true that he was assisted in his research by
many experiments already tried elsewhere; but he
dreamed of something different and, in the calm of Whitcomb
Mansions, had studied without respite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; he reflected. &#8220;All those sails, all that weight!
Boxes heaped one on the top of the other&mdash;cubes to catch
the air&mdash;a man sitting inert in a basket, with his hand
on a lever and a crank: it&#8217;s as though one tried to make
a stuffed bird fly! And what becomes of the man in all
that: the back push, the daring stroke? The man has got
to be the backbone of the machine, with his quick balancings,
his bendings, which are worth more than any
wheelwork.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, always, his inventive imagination built on without
respite, pulled down, built up again.</p>
<p>His daily success at the Hippodrome did not divert
him from the end he had in view. &#8220;Bridging the Abyss,&#8221;
for him, was but a means of making money, to enable
him to climb higher. He thought of nothing but that:
getting on, climbing higher; and this obsession of the
future made him scorn or rather overlook the temptations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
of the stage. He would only have had to choose among
the lot. All, down to the great Parisienne, would have
jumped at a champagne supper with Jimmy, the famous
bill-topper, the man who looked like the swells in the
front boxes and who made such a &#8220;pile.&#8221; But Jimmy
knew all about that: he left the theater in the quietest
way, took a glass of ale with the boys or girls at the
Crown, had a light supper and went home. And sometimes
a frenzy for work made him rush to his table, as
though the band of the Hippodrome were shaking his
nerves:</p>
<p>&#8220;Get to work,&#8221; he would growl, &#8220;get to work, cheesy
brain!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Pa, I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve got to, my little siree!&#8221; he insisted, with
a flickering smile.</p>
<p>And he read treatises, made diagrams; took up his compasses
again ... or else stayed as he was, with his
chin in his hand, plunged in his thoughts, his mind soaring
above London.... He seemed to fly over the
huge city, whose distant rumbling rose up to him, similar
to the roar of the sea.... Oh, he would succeed,
he knew he would! And he felt within himself an
increasing will of so tenacious a character that he could
have swung it, so it seemed to him, like a battering-ram
against the obstacle to be overcome and then:</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it!&#8221; he would growl, banging his fist on the
table. &#8220;That thief in the night! What a sweet wife he
got hold of! Poor Lily, to fall into such hands! Ah, yes,
she would have done better to stay at home!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Jimmy got to work again, to forget Lily; and he
kept on thinking of her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn that girl!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></p>
<p>What on earth did he think of her for ... when he
didn&#8217;t love her, after all?</p>
<p>Even during his triumphal tour of the Eastern and
Western Trust, that Lily, whom he did not love, haunted
his memory. At first, he hoped to forget her in his life
of excessive activity. And he saw so many theaters, as
many as Lily did in England: so many artistes, on so
many stages ... faces whom he had already met in
England: fair wigs, scarlet legs, boyish voices; &#8220;Roofers,&#8221;
&#8220;brothers&#8221; and &#8220;sisters,&#8221; returning from London, Manchester,
or Glasgow. He would have ended by seeing
them all again in time. There were other Lilies shooting
up, Lilies &#8220;that high,&#8221; elbowed by every vice, petted by
every hand, kissed by every pair of lips. His sympathy
went out to them all; and Lily had lived amid all
that; it was just her life. He found something to remind
him of her at every turn, on those stages on which
she had performed. He seemed to see her near him, with
her light walk, in her little black dress, looking so nice
in her &#8220;performing-dog&#8221; toque: the poor little silly thing,
running away with that thief in the night and left alone
now, quite alone, it appeared, among the &#8220;rotten lot.&#8221;
The thought drove him mad:</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn that girl!&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;I don&#8217;t love
her. Then why am I always thinking about her?&#8221;</p>
<p>And he rushed into work, into danger, when he
thought of that; risked terrible leaps in &#8220;Bridging the
Abyss.&#8221; He sometimes felt as though he were rushing
toward oblivion, into the jaws of death! And his great
project also nearly outweighed Lily&#8217;s influence:</p>
<p>&#8220;What are the leaps in &#8216;Bridging the Abyss,&#8217;&#8221; he
thought, &#8220;if not a fractional flight? If I had two flat
surfaces, one on either side, and a motor behind me, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
seems to me that I should continue to go upward; and
the best rudder would be the man riding it, with his
flexible body, his springy back: a live weight is less
heavy than a dead weight. How many hundred volts
does pluck stand for ... or skill ... or hatred
... or love?&#8221;</p>
<p>By dint of composing his machine in his head and
studying it on paper, Jimmy grew calmer. He thought
less about Lily, or, at least, thought about her only in her
interest, not his. For instance, in that little town in the
West which was not on his tour, but in which Trampy
had appeared, Jimmy tried to obtain information. He
went out of his way in order to make inquiries. A marriage
with Trampy Wheel-Pad? It was impossible to
discover anything; and he would not be able to make Lily
the magnificent present which he had dreamed of: her
divorce from Trampy!</p>
<p>And &#8220;Miss Lily,&#8221; Miss Lily, always; he was not satisfied
with thinking of her, he heard her name mentioned.
Boys and girls who had seen Lily in England and whom
the chances of travel brought across his path in America
told him with many amplifications, of her outrageous
adventures, her passion for flirting. She no longer did
all her turn. She paid more attention to her dresses
than to her performance. She was extravagant, traveled
with her maid, put up at the big hotels. She received
bouquets, my, as big as cabs, and invitations to supper
and post-cards covered with x x x x! She had an autograph-book
full of declarations of love. Motor-cars, furnished
houses: she was offered everything. The son of a
lord had ruined himself in jewelry for her, the impersonator
was nearly off his head for love of her, gee, she
did have a good time! She spent her life receiving chocolates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
and sweets and distributing her photograph as Lady
Godiva, with her signature. Lily, according to them, laid
waste every heart; men had left wife and children for her
sake; her love affairs were going the round of the world,
like her whippings. Lily was the thing; and game and
mustard for Jim Crow.</p>
<p>These tales left Jimmy very sad. He made allowances
for professional exaggeration in matters of love as of
smackings, but, nevertheless, there must be some truth
in what they said, for it reached him from various sides.
Oh, he pitied that dear little Lily from the bottom of his
heart! The harm was done, the theater had spoiled the
woman. This time, he felt that it was finished, between
her and him.... He, no doubt&mdash;who could tell?&mdash;would
continue his forward progress, and, one day, he
would have a wife of his own, a woman without a past,
and he would take his stand firmly on the earth, with a
home and love; and Lily, soon, would be little more than a
dead memory....</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his brain, redoubling in vigor amid those
stormy squalls, took in everything, seized everything in
a wide sense, became steeped in life, rejected bitterness
and retained enthusiasm. He heaped up personal observations
which he noted every evening, enough to
build the ideal music-hall one day. Harrasford, he
knew, was cherishing that plan. Perhaps they would
realize it together? And the retreat for the aged and
the home of rest for the sick, and, in each capital or
large town, a local artistes&#8217; home&mdash;like the Sailors&#8217;
Home&mdash;a little corner of England, providing comfort
for the man and protection for the girl. And his scheme,
his scheme was ripe now, the bold stroke which would
enable him to realize all the rest later. He felt the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
strength within him, if not to succeed, at least to
dare everything: &#8220;Brass Heart,&#8221; as he had been christened
at &#8217;Frisco. He had served an apprenticeship to
will-power: he had bruised his ribs with a vengeance in
a fall at the Columbia Theater at Cincinnati; he had
nearly split his skull at the Milwaukee Majestic; he had
shed his blood at the Washington Orpheum; and he was
going to risk more with his new invention. No matter,
he had now but one idea, to return to England, in spite
of magnificent offers from Australia.</p>
<p>The moment he reached London, he set to work. And
he fixed up the whole apparatus at his leisure, in the
shed which he had kept, notwithstanding the expense:
a sort of large hall in which he had already rehearsed
his &#8220;Bridging the Abyss.&#8221; Here, with a couple
of confidential assistants who had traveled with him in
America, he worked from morning till night, correcting,
revising, improving, in the midst of stretched cords and
nets. And then came his interview with Harrasford, his
engagement at the Astrarium, his meeting with Lily, in
the dressing-room passage....</p>
<p>And it was untrue! What they had said about her was
a lie! Lily had not fallen! Jimmy, merely at that moment&#8217;s
sight of her, would have sworn it in the face of
the whole world: the tales about Lily, due probably to
professional boasting on her own part,&mdash;were false! He
knew it, because he had seen her magnificent anger and
the flash from her chaste eyes. And he would give Lily
that joy&mdash;he owed at least as much as that to his dead
love&mdash;and he would see that it was all right. It would
not be a question of:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pa, I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve got to, my little lady!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></p>
<p>She would have to dare of her own accord, with a will
of adamant, and Lily would do it, Jimmy was sure of
that. He had found the partner wanted for his success
and he rejoiced to the bottom of his heart as he led Lily
to the stage of the Astrarium.</p>
<p>Lily, on the other hand, felt an anxiety which made her
sides ache and her heart beat:</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth can it be?&#8221; she asked herself.</p>
<p>But, whatever it was, she would do it if it cost her her
skin! And Lily did not even take the stage oath, so sincere
and spontaneous was her resolve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you, Lily,&#8221; said Jimmy, seeing her look at
the hall and the opening in the ceiling as she passed. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a new trick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Lily, &#8220;new: it&#8217;ll be like the last, they&#8217;ll take
it from you as soon as it&#8217;s out. It&#8217;s like me, the tricks
which Pa invented and which the fat freaks cribbed from
me. Tricks are always copied, you know they are,&#8221; continued
Lily, who trembled at the thought of seeing others
beside herself topping the bill with that.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; said Jimmy, &#8220;they won&#8217;t take
this one from me; and yet I hope, in a few years&#8217; time,
to see it all over the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hope to have it taken from you in a few years
only, eh? But why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For all the world to profit by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the world on the back-wheel!&#8221; protested Lily, who
was always thinking bikes. &#8220;Then what will become of
the artistes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a few years, Lily, people won&#8217;t go about on wheels,&#8221;
said Jimmy jokingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will they do then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll fly!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></p>
<p>Lily would have burst out laughing, in other circumstances;
but they had now reached the stage. The iron
curtain was down. She looked round with scared eyes
for something out of the common. Jimmy, after making
sure that they were quite alone, walked up to the monster&#8217;s
cage, slid back the door ...</p>
<p>The aerobike, with wings wide open, seemed to loom
out of the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; cried Lily. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bird! So that was your brain-work
in Berlin and in ... What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was, in any case, a strange creature, with two inclined
planes, one on either side, that looked like wings;
and, at the back, it showed a screw-propeller sticking up
in the air, like a tail. The whole thing rested on two
wheels.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s a bike, too! I knew it!&#8221; cried Lily, clapping
her hands. &#8220;Well done, Jimmy! And do you want me
to get up on it? Come along! Just wait till I take my
hat off,&#8221; she went on, drawing out the hat-pins from
under her big feathers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so fast!&#8221; said Jimmy, laughing. &#8220;Keep calm!
We&#8217;ll start next week. There are a good many little
things to make sure of first; and then I must put up a
cable in case of a fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a hang for a fall,&#8221; cried Lily, immensely
excited. &#8220;You&#8217;ll soon see if I&#8217;m afraid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be serious, Lily. Listen to me,&#8221; replied Jimmy. &#8220;Yes,
you will have to stand on the back-wheel, but not to ride
round the stage. You will have to start up at full speed
and then go up and up, straight up, into space and then
shoot out through a hole which they are making in the
roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Lily, &#8220;I saw. . . . My, that makes a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
good distance! And, when I&#8217;m through the hole, what do
I do up there? Go on...!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain all that to you,&#8221; said Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dive into the street, eh?&#8221; asked Lily, in her Spartan
voice. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care! Anything! I&#8217;ll do anything!
And I&#8217;ll show them,&#8221; she added, to herself, &#8220;if you can
do <i>that</i> through your gentlemen friends!&#8221;</p>
<p>But she calmed herself: after all, she was going to top
the bill; have her name in all the papers, with her portrait;
see the walls covered with her posters. What a revenge
for her! That was enough, for the moment. She
did not want to appear surprised before Jimmy. The
right thing was to take it as something very natural, like
a lady who is used to the best.</p>
<p>Jimmy, meanwhile, was explaining his trick:</p>
<p>&#8220;We shan&#8217;t fly at once,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We shall practise
on the stand to learn how the handles work. Oh, you&#8217;ll
have to think of everything during the few seconds that
the flight lasts! The machine isn&#8217;t perfect, it&#8217;s a first attempt,
it can only be ridden by a professional and a very
clever one. Look here,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;it&#8217;s the principle of
the back-wheel; you&#8217;ll have to keep your side-balance and
front and back, but you&#8217;ll do it, I&#8217;m sure. <i>I&#8217;ve</i> done it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you can do, a man,&#8221; Lily interrupted, &#8220;I can do
too. One can do anything on the bike!&#8221;</p>
<p>The machine which Jimmy explained to Lily in detail
was a bike just like another, with a few differences in its
general construction, bearing upon the services which it
was expected to perform. The saddle, for instance, was
made to slide backward and forward, so that the center
of equilibrium could be shifted with a push of the rider&#8217;s
back. The stability of the apparatus did not depend upon
that alone. The ascensional rudder or screw-propeller,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
which was able to impart a speed of thirty miles an hour
to the machine, was in the extension of the horizontal
bar of the frame. It was fitted to a long piece of
bent steel, pinned below the saddle, which, running beside
the frame, ended by forming a pedal, so that, with
a pressure of the foot, the rider could move it downward,
at will, within an arc of some ten degrees. This
propeller, which was small in dimensions, but endowed
with enormous speed, was, in its normal position, perpendicular
to the frame. The pressure of the foot raised
it to its highest point. In this position, the propeller
turned at full speed and therefore tended to descend and,
consequently, to point the front of the aerobike upward.
When brought still lower, its ascensional force increased
and the front of the aerobike pitched downward. These
two extremes would obviously serve only in sudden movements.
In reality, the rider&#8217;s skill would consist in moving
the propeller only very slightly, in order to maintain
a horizontal flight. As for the machine itself, Jimmy had
rejected the cumbersome system of cells, which he compared
to boxes:</p>
<p>&#8220;The shape of a fish for the ship, the shape of a bird
for the flying-machine,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He stuck to that principle and therefore he had added
two enormous wings, one on each side. He had first experimented
with reduced models, shaped like a bird,
sending them up anyhow, to see, and he had ended by constructing
one which preserved its stability when gliding
over the atmospheric layers. He had thus been led to construct
wings with a slightly rounded surface whose coefficient
of yield was nearly double that of wings with flat
surfaces. The width of these wings was about five feet
and their length about sixteen. They tapered a little,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
were drawn out in front and widened at the opposite end,
so as to get a more powerful hold of the air. They were
made of double-milled canvas, stretched on curved ash
and fastened to the sections by aluminum stays riveted
with copper and clenched. They were as light as they
were stiff. These two wings pointed slightly upward in
front, parallel to the machine, and were fastened to it in
the middle by means of an axis below the saddle-pillar,
which brought their axis to the center of gravity. Other
ingenious and quite individual arrangements made the
apparatus very manageable. The resistance of the air,
combined with the propelling power of the screw, exercised
all its force in vain: the wings remained stationary.
Their lines were carefully studied to facilitate the flow
of the air, on the principle of Langley&#8217;s kite: and the two
of them presented a carrying surface of forty-nine square
feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not much,&#8221; Jimmy explained to Lily, who listened
attentively. &#8220;If I carried my motor,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I should
have a bigger surface. The machine ought then, theoretically
speaking, to rise when it is going at a rate
of thirty miles an hour; with a good back push the
front-wheel would leave the ground and continue its
course upward. But, on the stage, we have no room to
acquire speed: we shall get it from an inclined plane, as
at the start of &#8216;Looping the Loop.&#8217; As for the side steering,
the front wheel has spokes fitted with canvas and
offers resistance to the air: it will steer the aerobike to
left or right at a touch of the handle-bar, as in ordinary
riding, and there you are, Lily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; said Lily, bewildered by all this complicated apparatus.
&#8220;Did you work it all out on paper? It&#8217;s enough
to drive one mad!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re on it, Lily,&#8221; said Jimmy, smiling, &#8220;you&#8217;ll
have to work also, <i>I</i> promise you. But, with your talent,
... you&#8217;ll manage better than I should. And to-morrow,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;I will give you something on
account of your salary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have money,&#8221; said Lily, very proudly and fearing
lest she should wear out her luck by adding that to
it, by being paid for doing nothing....</p>
<p>Lily spent the whole week in a fever of expectation;
she did not know where she was for joy. But she stifled
that within herself. And it was owing to her talent, all
owing to her talent! When people wanted a difficult trick
done, they did not go to Daisy or the fat freaks, no, they
came to little Lily! And it was settled, she wanted no
more familiarity, now that she was going to top the
bill at the Astrarium! A lady should be more reserved
in her friendships: she would make herself very short-sighted,
so short-sighted as to be almost blind, when she
met the rotten lot! Resolved, that she would give up saying,
&#8220;Damn it!&#8221; give up talking of smackings and using
vulgar expressions:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you hear, Glass-Eye?&#8221; she said, calling her maid
to witness. &#8220;You&#8217;re to box my ears if you catch me at it
again!&#8221;</p>
<p>The thought of having to handle that delicate machine
increased Lily&#8217;s importance in her own eyes. She had
noticed that Poland, apart from an inordinate love of
champagne suppers, had very nice manners: Lily would
profit by her example and become more refined; she would
show Pa and Ma the kind of Lily they had lost and she
would crush them with the amount of her salary! She
would earn more by herself than the whole troupe. She
would let them know it, even if she had to do the trick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
for nothing, for glory, to see her Ma beg her pardon on
her knees! She had recovered all the pride of her eighteen
years, all her freshness, in a day: the touch of bitterness
about her lips had changed into a smile. It would have
taken very little more to make her dance for joy. But she
restrained herself, dared not believe in her happiness;
and she was quite decided not to accept anything from
Jimmy before earning it. It was bad enough to owe him
that thousand marks. She made herself a nice practising
dress and spent the morning in bed reading a novel of
fashionable life, of which the heroine was called Lily, like
herself! And she, too, would become a society-girl, just
to show them, damn it! But, suddenly, catching herself
at fault, she laughed and asked Glass-Eye for a box on
the ear; and a desperate pillow-fight ensued, in which
they indulged whole-heartedly, like two regular tom-boys
who loved to wrestle and punch each other. And it put
her in a good humor for the rest of the day. She went
shopping through the windows, only bought herself a
spray of roses to fasten to her bodice. She went to the
Astrarium, walked in as though the place belonged to
her, followed by her maid. She examined the works
with the eye of an expert. Three days, three days more
and she would begin to rehearse! Her legs were itching
to commence!</p>
<p>The alterations to the stage especially interested her.
The door of the cage remained closed and Lily looked at
the auditorium:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible, after all?&#8221; she thought.</p>
<p>And she measured the distance with her eye. It seemed
enormous to her, but never mind, she&#8217;d do it! And she
grew wildly enthusiastic in the midst of all that activity,
of a theater which was being rearranged for her:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
&#8220;For me, Glass-Eye! All of it for me! From here,&#8221;
she said, stamping her foot on the stage, &#8220;from here to
right up there!&#8221; And she pointed to the hole in the sky.
&#8220;All that on the bike! A somersault miles high!&#8221;</p>

OLD MARTELLO<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Glass-Eye opened two terrified eyes, wondered if Lily
was going mad....</p>
<p>Glass-Eye had become dulled through constant obedience,
had lost her memory, mixed up her yeses and noes,
like those actors who forget their parts through playing
them too frequently; her recent life had excited her too
much, and never a sou in her pocket, only barely enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
to eat ... it was ten times worse than in Rathbone
Place.... And then that new crotchet of Lily&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I fly, Glass-Eye, or can&#8217;t I? Am I a bird or am
I not?&#8221; It was enough to make Glass-Eye lose her
head....</p>
<p>Glass-Eye was obliged to answer yes ... and that
very quickly. But she kept on trotting behind Lily, who,
realizing that she would soon be taken up with her rehearsals,
took advantage of her last days of liberty to pay
visits and show herself a little, accompanied by her maid,
like the fine lady that she was. She went and took the
Bambinis some candies. Poor kids! Their games and
laughter no longer filled the hotel with mirth and gaiety:
old Martello was getting worse and worse and was now
not able to leave his room at all. Lily found a kind word
for everybody and was grieved at not having any money,
which would have allowed her to be generous. That
would come later. She worked out a scheme for occupying
herself with the children when the old man was gone,
for having them always with her, like two dear little lucky
charms. It was impossible, of course: never mind, it was
the idea of a lady, which she would not have had in the
old days, and Lily was pleased with herself for having
entertained it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will speak about you to Jimmy,&#8221; she said to the
Bambinis. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get you engaged at the Astrarium, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>And the old man trembled with delight, stammered out
his thanks, tried to accompany her to the door, like a
princess; and the little boy, to thank her, promised to
teach her a way of standing on your head which he had
learned all by himself!</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor darlings!&#8221; thought Lily, as she left them. &#8220;If
ever they fall into their brother&#8217;s hands! They would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
better dead! Luckily for them, he has disappeared for
good; and his Ave Maria with him, unluckily for me!&#8221;</p>
<p>For Lily understood how badly her position as a lady
went with that name of Mrs. Trampy. It was like dragging
a tin kettle at her skirts, to make the people in the
street turn round and look at her.</p>
<p>And, more than ever before, Trampy posed as a faithful
husband. Nothing sufficed to take down his arrogance.
Always the same old Trampy: great, by Jove!
And, with his red lips, his glittering eye and the cigar
stuck in the corner of his mouth, he made love to second-rate
&#8220;sisters,&#8221; inferior Roofers in red calico skirts. His
glamorous title as the bill-topper&#8217;s husband still won him
a few conquests. And Trampy, especially since Jimmy&#8217;s
return, plumed himself more and more on the fact that
he was the husband of his dear little wife!</p>
<p>Lily knew all this and it made her fume with rage at
heart; but she showed nothing, pretended, on the contrary,
to treat it as a little matter of no account. For
instance, after her visit to the Bambinis, as she passed an
artistes&#8217; bar, quite close, there stood Trampy, lording it
on the pavement, among a lot of unemployed pros. Lily
made herself short-sighted to the point of absolute blindness.
Trampy caught her, as she passed, with a:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Lily! Hullo, my dear little wife!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Lily behaved like a real fine lady who knows how
to put people in their place without calling them names:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Mr. Trampy!&#8221; she replied, in a sarcastic tone.
&#8220;Still got your red-hot stove, Mr. Trampy? Still a success
with the girls? Kind regards, Mr. Trampy!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>But Lily was grandest of all at the rehearsals. She was
now no longer a lady: she once more became the Spartan,
bare-necked, her hair undone, her body streaming with
perspiration, and to work, to work, to make up for lost
time! In the mornings, alone on the deserted stage, she
practised and practised....</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;And mind you do your
work properly,&#8221; he added, with a laugh, &#8220;or else, you
know ...&#8221;</p>
<p>And he patted the back of his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care!&#8221; said Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may break your head, you know,&#8221; continued
Jimmy, to try her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s none of your damned business if I do! Show me
your tricks. To work!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Jimmy showed her a movement to execute on her
bike, which she had brought with her: balancings, as in
&#8220;Bridging the Abyss,&#8221; an excellent training for the aerobike.
And Lily went about it clear-eyed, hard-cheeked,
with all the little muscles contracted on her stubborn forehead,
ready to butt at the obstacle. A few falls to begin
with, but she jumped up again nimbly:</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right!&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s part of the game!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But stop, stop,&#8221; insisted Jimmy. &#8220;Be careful!&#8221;</p>
<p>They were sometimes on the stage for hours at a time,
but to Lily, all wrapped in her work, it seemed so many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
minutes. She understood the jerk which she was to give
at the moment when, after rolling along the inclined
plane, she should shoot out into space for the soaring
flight of fifty yards:</p>
<p>&#8220;The start, that&#8217;s the great thing with the back-wheel,&#8221;
she observed. &#8220;The rest goes of itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry till you&#8217;re out of the wood!&#8221; said Jimmy.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll be different when you&#8217;re riding the aerobike.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily was longing to begin that famous practice! And,
a few days later, she at last had that delight, took that
further step toward triumph. Jimmy removed the bird
from the cage, fixed it on a stand. When Lily sat in the
saddle, she was crimson with pleasure, prouder than a
princess sitting on a throne for the first time:</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Here I am! And what next?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy explained the complicated touches&mdash;&#8220;Press
your left foot, there, like that, to make it point upward&#8221;&mdash;and
showed how, explained why; then he passed to the
working of the handle-bar&mdash;&#8220;There, like that, to turn it,
there&#8221;&mdash;and how and why the saddle slipped backward
and forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all?&#8221; repeated Lily. &#8220;That won&#8217;t want any
smackings! Let&#8217;s see, like this, eh? Then that. Suppose
I&#8217;m coming down at full speed. I throw myself
backward, a back push, there, like that. A kick, gently,
there, that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ll do it as soon as you like! This minute,
if necessary!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jimmy, without replying to these sallies, proceeded
methodically. He made her practise again, standing still,
with the motor going at half-speed. This was a different
impulse: the displacement of the air raised a stormy wind,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
the dust flew, the scenery hanging from the flies waved
to and fro and Lily shook in her saddle under the vibration
of the propeller.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Lily?&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;That shakes you up, eh?
That complicates matters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;And what about the boards?
There are some of them that are pretty rough, too! At
Pittsburg, you know, it&#8217;s like riding over cobblestones.
I prefer that to a stage that&#8217;s too smooth: it&#8217;s less treacherous.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few days later, Jimmy ran up a steel cable from the
stage to the opening in the ceiling, which was now finished
and covered with a tarpaulin; and Lily was to try
the flying. At the time for practice, there was no one in
the theater, from which the scaffoldings had been removed.
There were no seats on the floor or in the boxes:
everything was being made outside, and would be put in
place in a day or two. In the afternoon, when there was
no practice, the house was filled with workmen, painters,
upholsterers, carpenters, whose places were taken by others
at night, working by electric light. Ten days more
and they would have the triumphal opening; already Paris
was covered with picture placards: you saw Tom, as a
caryatid, supporting the weight of a palace; the Three
Graces entwined in their radiant nudity; the impersonator
standing, like a Don Juan, surrounded by a bevy of
women: the ballet-girl, the shop-girl, the fine lady; then,
besides those, the New Trickers&mdash;&#8220;My idea!&#8221; thought
Lily, but she didn&#8217;t care a jot now&mdash;the New Trickers
fluttered round Daisy. You saw the elephants; the monkey;
Patti-Patty, the white negress; all, all, down to the
Bambinis, whom Lily had &#8220;got&#8221; engaged. The whole
program was reverberated on the walls and hoardings,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
like a thousand-voiced echo. An even larger poster than
the others, all blue, strewn with stars, displayed the aerobike
in full flight in the sky; and a human figure, seated
upon it, lifted a hand filled with rays.</p>
<p>The mere sight of the posters was enough to stimulate
Lily to the maddest feats of daring. She felt herself
firmer than steel, when she thought of the New Trickers
and of Pa and Ma, who were coming with Daisy, their
farthing dip!</p>
<p>When everything was ready, Jimmy hung the aerobike
to the steel cable by two ropes, ten feet long, ending in
pulleys which ran along the cable. Each of these two
ropes was looped up and the loop secured with thin twine:
this was an infallible way of ascertaining if the aerobike
weighed down upon them or if it was supporting itself
in the air; the two cords acted as a spring balance registering
the tension in the rope. Should the twine break,
because the aerobike rested on the ropes, then the ropes
would unloop and the machine remain hanging without
any danger for Lily. This was the way in which Jimmy
had worked when learning &#8220;his trade as a bird,&#8221; as he
called it; and Lily, he had no doubt, would succeed even
better than he did, being more supple, lighter and quite
as plucky.</p>
<p>Oh, the rapture with which Lily bestrode the aerobike
for the first flight!</p>
<p>Jimmy and two confidential assistants hauled up the
machine to the top of the inclined plane that gave it its
impetus. Jimmy spent an endless time in verifying
and testing everything. The electric wire that set the
propeller in motion also caused him uneasiness. It had
to unroll behind and follow the aerobike without weighing
upon it, without retarding its flight; for the machine,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
which was necessarily a small one, to be able to move
within a confined space, did not carry the additional
load of a motor, but only a wire, as wireless transmission
of power was not yet available. At last, when everything
was provided for, Jimmy allowed Lily to make her
trial. He trembled; not that she ran any danger, for
a fall was impossible: the machine was stopped, up above,
automatically, by a cable stretched crosswise and fastened
to a strong spring, which slowed and stayed the flight
within the space of a few yards. But if the two pieces of
twine broke suddenly and if this happened several times
in succession, the shocks might come to frighten Lily,
for all her self-control.</p>
<p>And Jimmy went on explaining.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;I quite understand. It&#8217;s like
this, like this, yes, I know. It&#8217;s only a matter of trying!
It&#8217;s a trick I&#8217;ve got to do and that&#8217;s all about it! Daisy
would kill herself on it and so would the fat freaks, but
I shan&#8217;t! I shall succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, steady!&#8221; cried Jimmy, and his voice rang
through the empty theater. &#8220;Go!&#8221;</p>
<p>The machine ran down with a swoop, the propeller
whirred, Lily gave a magnificent back push, when she
reached the bottom of the inclined plane; then she went
straight up and the two pieces of twine snapped in two.
Lily found herself hanging fifty feet in the air, the two
pulleys glided slowly backward toward the stage. Jimmy
stopped the machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s wrong!&#8221; cried Lily. &#8220;Let&#8217;s try again. I see
what it was: I forgot to push down my foot to point the
machine up. It was a slip.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, at the next attempt, it went better. The
twine broke each time, but Lily rectified her movements:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my back push! It&#8217;s the propeller! It&#8217;s the front-wheel!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, in fact, that was what it was. Jimmy and his assistants,
who followed her with their eyes, had noted the
fault and Lily, too, had observed it, in spite of the giddy
flight. She was extraordinarily plucky and cool, her
eight stone of flesh and bone, unerring and exact, seemed
made for the aerobike.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo, Lily! Hurrah!&#8221; cried Jimmy.</p>
<p>She could have screamed for joy in the street, as she
went out.</p>
<p>Her unparalleled stroke of luck in being chosen tickled
her heart. She felt her sense of responsibility increase and
also her wish to do well; no sooner had she left off practising
than she was seized with but one idea, to begin
again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight days more!&#8221; she thought.</p>
<p>At night, she dreamed of backward jerks, of turning
the handle-bar, pushing the pedal. Poor Glass-Eye, cowering
in a corner of the bed, had terrible nightmares, and,
in the morning, after Lily&#8217;s kicks, she rose with her ribs
smarting and her shins all black and blue. That was all
her profit, for Lily had hardly any money left and was not
yet drawing a salary.</p>
<p>Lily submitted to all sorts of privation with a proud
dignity. She would be beholden to nobody. Soon her
whole fortune would consist of her box of lucky halfpence
and a franc which she had won by turning a cartwheel,
for a bet, among artistes, in the country, to
stagger the jossers. And so their little evening meal
was a scanty one. A sausage, a little fruit, a cup of tea
... and then to bed. That was better than listening
to the owner of the Hours and all those men who propose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
things to you. Never, never! Her work, her work! Lord,
after what she had seen of Poland and the Hours, it was
much simpler to work, to be self-reliant. At night, sometimes,
Lily would lie awake and think ... where did
that three hundred francs of the Bijou come from? Not
from the Bijou: Cataplasm&#8217;s defeat had swallowed up everything
and the theater had long been without a penny;
they used to fill the house with paper distributed among
the staff, with orders to get rid of it anyhow. They were
not far short of inviting soldiers from the barracks.
There had never been more than two hundred seats paid
for of an evening; it meant flat bankruptcy. And she was
the only one who had received anything: why? How?
Then it must have been some admirer, but who? Not the
architect, surely, that josser! Who then? And why
had Jimmy engaged the Bambinis, when she asked him
to? He did everything to please her. He was letting her
top the bill: why? She made a heap of guesses, without
getting at the exact truth ... Jimmy ...
Jimmy ... that man, with his coldness, interested
her. While so many others were prowling around her,
he alone seemed indifferent. She would have liked to see
him in love with her ... to make him suffer a little
in his turn! All the beauty-shows which Lily had
seen, all the exhibitions of painted Hours had not spoiled
her good taste: Jimmy pleased her, with that strong face
of his. What an endless pity that she had married
Trampy! She gave a scornful pout when she thought of
it: she married to Trampy! Married to that soaker:
she, a woman made for a man, a creature of flesh
and blood, who admired fine muscles, rough sport and
virile smackings! Gee, if she had been a man, it seemed
to her that she would have enjoyed spoiling a little Lily:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
outside working hours, of course! And, if a little Lily
had asked her, &#8220;Do you love me, yes or no?&#8221; she would
never have answered no. To-day, she would have bitten
off her own tongue rather than put that question to
Jimmy! And yet Jimmy had a dignity about him that
pleased her. She could see into the game of the others.
The architect, for instance, would give her just a smile in
passing, a pleasant word, as one performs a social duty,
between two pieces of business. A little amusement, no
more: that was all she was to him ... and to all of
them. Jimmy seemed different. But, still, if he loved
her, why hadn&#8217;t he the courage to tell her so? And,
besides, when all was said, she was sick and tired of men!
Some of them ran after you like dogs; others, damn it,
were icicles! A girl could have Marjutti&#8217;s figure, Thea&#8217;s
arms, Nancy&#8217;s legs, Lillian&#8217;s or Laurence&#8217;s face ...
and still they would not be satisfied! And thereupon
Lily pursed her brows, asked herself how and why and
went to sleep like a baby.</p>
<p>And the rehearsals continued every day, without respite.
Lily became terrible the nearer she drew to success:
her indomitable spirit mounted to her heart. Jimmy had
difficulty in holding her in. She made twenty flights,
thirty flights ... and the twine no longer broke.
From that moment, she was sure of succeeding, always.
When you have once succeeded, even if it be but once,
you have no right ever to fail again. She had been
brought up in those principles, had had them rubbed into
her skin. She could not fail now, it was impossible!
Even in her flight to the opening up above! She had
learned her &#8220;times,&#8221; she knew how to aim exactly at the
right spot. Jimmy hastened to have the roof arranged
for the final exit, when the aerobike would disappear before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
the eyes of the audience, in the star-strewn sky. All
that remained was to get everything ready for the final
rehearsal: the complete show, with all lights lit, as for
a gala night. Lily seemed to see it all beforehand. On
the day when she realized that no accident was possible,
that it was a trick of which she was certain, she stifled
a cry of triumph in her throat. She was afraid to believe
in it herself, so greatly did it surpass her dreams. She
would have stayed for days on the aerobike to experience
the delight of the leap into space. It seemed to
her as though she were becoming a bird and about to
hover in mid-air and leave them all behind her, in the
crowd below ... all, all ... and be a little
Lily, flying away on the back-wheel before their noses.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll make yourself ill,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;Take a rest;
there&#8217;s no need to tire yourself; you do it as well as I.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Jimmy, of course, had done the thing too, if only
to show Lily; besides, it was easy for him, who had
had so much practice in London and who knew his
machine from end to end. And he appreciated the difficulty
all the more. He admired Lily&#8217;s incredible pluck,
her all-devouring ambition and that splendid determination
to get out of her scrape, to be a little Lily earning
her bread as she knew how, by her work, even if she had
to break her neck in the doing of it! And proud to her
finger-tips, in spite of the dog&#8217;s life she had led.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had not procured her this delight,&#8221; thought Jimmy,
&#8220;I should never have forgiven myself to the end of
my days.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, from working with her for hours and hours, from
holding her by the waist at the first trials, from feeling
that little body quiver under his hand, from seeing Lily
rush at danger, Jimmy became madly in love with her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
again ... if he had ever ceased to be so! Ah, if
Trampy...! But Lily was married ... the
divorce depended on the husband ... and the husband
wouldn&#8217;t have it ... at any price: not for a
million, he said, by Jove, would he be separated from a
little wife whom he adored!</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Lily!&#8221; thought Jimmy sadly. &#8220;Will she always
be doomed to drag that dead weight about with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>During the intervals for rest, while Lily wiped the perspiration
from her forehead, Jimmy talked to her ...
at first, of insignificant things ... the name &#8220;Astrarium,&#8221;
for instance ... a place devoted to planets,
to stars: as a palmarium is to palms. Stars ...
that was to say, bill-toppers: the Three Graces; the
Laurences; the Lillians; the Marjuttis; the Lilies ...
yes, the Lilies! Then he pitied her for belonging to
Trampy; and what a good little Lily she would have been
if she had remained with her family!</p>
<p>&#8220;But I <i>am</i> a good little Lily!&#8221; she said, with a display
of childish vehemence. &#8220;What more do you want? We
artistes do what we jolly well please, and we don&#8217;t care a
damn for the rest!&#8221; And she had half a mind to tell him
that it was all his fault! &#8220;I had to do a silly thing and I
did it,&#8221; she continued, with an expression of regret on her
face. &#8220;I married without love, but lovers, my! I&#8217;ve had,
I may say, as many as I wanted ... from the son of
a lord down.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily, to excite him, told him the long array of her
love affairs, as it was told everywhere, on the Bill and
Boom Tour, on the Harrasford, on the Eastern and Western
Tours, like the whippings and the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; replied Jimmy, very coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, you don&#8217;t believe me!&#8221; exclaimed Lily. &#8220;There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
were men who would have left wife and child for me!
... heaps of lovers, tons of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor Lily, having so many is the same as having
none at all,&#8221; added Jimmy dreamily.</p>
<p>But still he did not declare his love: besides, he had
constantly to leave her, to go and give orders, or climb up
on the roof, or look at the heating-apparatus, below.</p>
<p>Lily watched him go, followed him with a sphinx-like
glance, while a vague smile flickered about her lips....</p>
<p>But she hardly had time to think of all this: the assistants
replaced the bird in its cage, locked the door, opened
that leading to the dressing-room passage and the artistes
arrived and took up their places on their carpets.</p>
<p>Lily had seen it a hundred times, a thousand times,
&#8220;millions of times!&#8221; She never wearied of it. She spent
the day there, among the groups of bloomers: the Three
Graces, bare-armed, went to work, practised the human
cluster; Nunkie kept an eye on his dear nieces and rehearsed
the Bambinis, now that old Martello was keeping
his room for good. Lily, who was almost reduced to eating
dry bread, but who remained the fine lady nevertheless,
brought them bags of sweets. Calmed by her work,
she sat down in a corner, laughed, her head thrown back,
full-throated, applauded the others with her thumbnail,
shook hands with new-comers, made herself liked by all.
And it was:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, girls! Hullo, boys! Dear old Blackpool!
What&#8217;s the news at the Palace? Who&#8217;s topping the bill
at the Hippodrome?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily, on her rickety chair, made as it were a little center
at which the news was exchanged; to think that, instead
of being there, at the top of the profession, she might
have been at Glasgow, some twopenny theater, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
ladies are admitted without shoes or stockings, or playing
the darky at Earl&#8217;s Court! Yes, but for Jimmy, that&#8217;s
where she would have been! Or else the Parisienne, in
Russia! She, an English girl, my! And Lily fervently
touched her lucky charm: oh, work, work, thank goodness
for it! And Lily rendered homage to work and
sprang from her chair to shake hands with Tom, who
had come to see his palace unpacked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Tom! Welcome!&#8221;</p>
<p>This Tom, who now topped the bill everywhere and
had a permanent address and his own scenery: wasn&#8217;t it
wonderful? He was no longer her Pa&#8217;s old servant:
genius removes all distances; a man is what he makes
himself! And they shook hands warmly, like equals.</p>
<p>Lily, as a sensational bill-topper and a friend of Jimmy&#8217;s,
was always in great request. She talked nicely,
without pose of any kind, like a woman who is sure of
herself and knows things. The Astrarium ... the
Astrarium ... what did that mean? They asked
Lily:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like ... a palmarium,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;with
sunflowers in it, all sorts of things ... girls ...
stars ...&#8221;</p>
<p>She described her journeys, storms, gee! Weren&#8217;t there,
Glass-Eye? People who had never been outside Europe
and the States had no idea! Lily talked of India, Africa,
Australia; talked of lions, which stand on their hind-legs
when they&#8217;re angry, and tigers, which lie down flat; mentioned
stage friendships between elephants and camels
and herself in the midst of it all: &#8220;That high!&#8221; lowering
her hand to six inches from the floor; talked of animal-training:
dogs, cats, sea-lions and that &#8220;great, big,
wicked Australian rabbit&#8221; which boxed like a man. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
was a well-informed person, was Lily. And a providence
for her family also, to listen to her. When any one
brought news of her Pa and the New Trickers, with
Daisy as a statue on her pedestal, one of the successes of
the year:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Lily replied, in a patronizing tone, &#8220;I know.
It was my idea. I gave it to them!&#8221;</p>
<p>They thought it very nice of her. She listened with
great dignity to what they said about the New Trickers.
They would not be at the Astrarium on the opening night.
They were finishing an engagement on the Bill and Boom
that same evening. They would be in Paris the next day.
Mr. Clifton was reckoning on this appearance for the final
triumph of his troupe ... and he deserved it. What
a man, Mr. Clifton, what a man! &#8220;Not easy to please, eh,
Lily?&#8221; And the inevitable gesture followed. But Lily
would have none of that now, she would not hear her Pa
spoken of as a brute! Did they take her for a performing
dog? One was born with the gift or else one remained
all one&#8217;s life a Daisy or a fat freak! She was proud to
have a Pa like hers. She wasn&#8217;t a mountebank picked
up on the road! Lily had a Pa and a Ma: a Ma of her
own, a Ma whom she was certain about. She bore a well-known
name. She belonged to the &#8220;father and son&#8221;
aristocracy of the music-hall. She had never needed
&#8220;that&#8221; to make her practice, she an artiste, brought up
like a lady:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t I, Glass-Eye? Tom, wasn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>And the jewelry and the sweets her Pa bought her,
my! Tons of it! Of course, he would stand no nonsense
about behavior; and Lily made them all laugh till
the tears came about that footy rotter who made love to
her in London, before the time when drink made him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
look so disgusting, and, when she loitered in the street
with him, Pa, the moment she reached the door, caught
her such a blow that she took all the steps to the basement
at one jump; and there found her Ma waiting for
her ... gee!</p>
<p>&#8220;And they were quite right, too! And ... do
they know that I&#8217;m going to top the bill at the Astrarium?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they think you&#8217;re in Spain or somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhere!&#8221; said Lily to herself, with a thrill at her
heart. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show them!&#8221;</p>
<p>She choked with joy at the idea of the startled look
on the faces of Pa and Ma when they saw her on the
aerobike. An exuberant gladness filled her heart. And
that feverish work, those laborers everywhere, the opening
in the roof, the terrace up above, those posters all
over Paris and there, behind the iron door, in the dark,
the bird! It was all for her: a theater for herself! And
she felt a need to leap, to laugh, to spread gaiety all
around her; and she rushed about madly with the Bambinis,
romped with them behind the pillars, rolled with
them on the floor of her dressing-room, became once again
the Lily who had played truant all around the world, inventing
practical jokes in India and climbing apple-trees
in Honolulu. She crossed the combs and tooth-brushes
on the Roofer girls&#8217; tables, rushed into their room when
they were undressed, drove the trembling herd of them
distracted, talked of the thousand dangers that awaited
them if they didn&#8217;t mend their ways, made them fly to
their lucky charms to ward off ill-luck, when she offered
them a yellow flower, with great pomp, or some broken
glass in a jewel-box. Then she talked to the Three
Graces, those big girls who always astonished her with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
their cloistered existence&mdash;Nunkie before everything&mdash;and
who amused themselves by measuring one another
round the biceps, round the chest, or else, with their
elbows on the table, played at who should first bend back
the other&#8217;s wrist. Lily sat down for a moment with
them, then stopped,
breathless with larking
and talking, and
went back to her
dressing-room:</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have
months to spend in
here!&#8221; she thought.</p>
<div class='figleft'>
<img src='images/illus-pg344.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 203px; height: 274px;' /><br />
<p class='captionc' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 203px;'>
LILY&#8217;S GOLLYWOG<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>And, assisted by
Glass-Eye, she pinned
up bits of stuff, tied a
silk bow to the back of
the chair, put up nails
for her costumes, laid
out on her table long
rows of post-cards,
photographs of
friends, all dispersed
to the four quarters of the globe, some dead, others done
for, all the poor witnesses of her life. Then she took her
black gollywog from her trunk and kissed it passionately&mdash;&#8220;Darling!
Darling! Darling!&#8221;&mdash;before hanging it up
on the wall. And along the dressing-room passage and
through the window came the sound of voices ...
snatches of homesick tunes: <i>From Rangoon to Mandalay</i>
or <i>Way down upon the Suwanee River</i> ...
and &#8220;Hullo, Lily! Hullo, old boy!&#8221;... The female-impersonator
walked into her room as though it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
were his own, sat down on the basket trunk, plunging his
green eyes into hers.</p>
<p>And sometimes Jimmy passed, always at a run: something
had gone wrong somewhere, the heating apparatus,
the electric light....</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Lily!&#8221; And he stopped for a moment, frowned
at the sight of the impersonator. &#8220;Always busy?&#8221; he
asked, seeing Lily, bare-armed, washing something in
her basin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have to be,&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;I always wash my little
blouses; we do everything ourselves, don&#8217;t we, Glass-Eye?
And, when I&#8217;m performing, I have two pairs of
tights to wash a day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two pairs of tights!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course, matinée and night! You have no
idea, Jimmy ... the nickel ... when I sit on
the handle-bar, it makes a great mark ... just here,
look!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she laughed at Jimmy over her shoulder while
she pointed to the place ... and then blushed, like
a frolicsome child that has been found out and is, oh, so
sorry!</p>
<p>&#8220;Every one&#8217;s got to keep to his own dressing-room!&#8221;
said Jimmy, feeling very uncomfortable, to the man with
the green eyes. &#8220;You can&#8217;t stay here; it&#8217;s against the
rules!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing no harm, please, Mr. Jimmy,&#8221; retorted
Lily, sitting down beside the impersonator and slipping
her arm round his waist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Jimmy!&#8221; said the impersonator, when the other
had left the room in a rage. &#8220;He&#8217;s jealous, isn&#8217;t he,
darling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He jealous? Then why doesn&#8217;t he say so? One
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
can&#8217;t guess a thing like that! When you&#8217;re a man,
you speak out!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the architect appeared in his turn, he, too, running
from one end of the theater to the other. He wore
a bandage over one eye:</p>
<p>&#8220;Knocked up against a beam ... a little accident.
Have you seen Jimmy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s over there, I think,&#8221; replied Lily, without troubling
to look at him.</p>
<p>There was no jealousy about the architect. He stayed
for a moment, sniffed at the scent-bottle, smiled at the
photographs on the wall. A green-eyed impersonator, a
blue-eyed impersonator: the room could have been full of
impersonators, for all he cared. Dark girls, yellow girls,
fair girls, so many playthings to distract him from his
rules and compasses. He was bored at once; turned to
another at once; and it was all so amusing! He was the
typical lover of the woman of the stage, with his little
surface passions. And very amiable withal, knowing
them all, and friendly with them, a great purveyor of
anecdotes:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Para-Paras, you know, Lily, committed suicide
in their room ... awful poverty. The wife wasn&#8217;t
... Tottie enough ... and the husband was
teaching the English accent to continental clowns! Poland?
A magnificent engagement in Russia. Old Martello
hasn&#8217;t three days to live. Oh ... and
Nunkie! There&#8217;s news among the Three Graces! The
troupe&#8217;s done for this time!&#8221;</p>
<p>And he told how, last night, poor Thea, while mending
her uncle&#8217;s overcoat, found in the lining an old letter
from America ... from some swain she had had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
over there ... a letter glowing with love and regret.
Yes, Nunkie knew how to hold his nieces, the architect
explained, laughing ... watched them like a Spanish
duenna, confiscated the letters that came for them, if
necessary, the old rogue, and calmed their ardors with a
few drops of bromide in a glass of water, every evening,
on the pretense of keeping them from catching cold in the
drafts. Oh, the old rogue! And Thea had almost fainted
with grief in her dressing-room when she read the letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a business, Lily! A scandal in their little home!
Very funny, eh?&#8221; he added, as he ogled Lily&#8217;s pigeon&#8217;s
eggs and rolled a cigarette.</p>
<p>Lily, who had seen poor Thea cry before and who
knew to what extent her lover&#8217;s treachery had humiliated
her, was secretly furious to hear that josser talk carelessly
of things like that: did he imagine, the idiot, that they
weren&#8217;t built like other people, in the profession, that they
had no feelings? What need had the public to know
about their lives? It was among themselves, quite among
themselves, all that!</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of my sight, you damned josser!&#8221; said Lily.
&#8220;Go and eat coke!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the other, greatly amused, described his latest
discovery, a pearl, in an out-of-the-way neighborhood
... at Vaugirard fair ... an extraordinary girl,
showing off on a couple of trestles in front of a canvas
booth, in which her man lifted weights to the light of the
Argand burners:</p>
<p>&#8220;Picture this girl, Lily,&#8221; said the enthusiastic josser,
&#8220;picture this girl on her trestles, doing weights, balancings,
all sorts of things. A body like a boy&#8217;s, all muscle,
and thin: whew! Not <i>that</i> much fat on her, no hips,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
arms and shoulders, like Michael Angelo&#8217;s flayed model.
And I talked to her afterward! And her man gave me
a queer look you know ... I got a blow....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well done!&#8221; cried Lily, clapping her hands. &#8220;The
beam, eh? That&#8217;ll teach you to meddle in other people&#8217;s
business! Oh, you don&#8217;t know those tenters! One of
these days you&#8217;ll be picked up with your face smashed in,
or shot through the chest with a revolver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, though,&#8221; the architect interrupted, &#8220;that girl
... I don&#8217;t know how we came to speak of you
... she knows you, Lily!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! Now I have mountebanks among my
acquaintances!&#8221; said Lily, with an air of disgust. &#8220;Get
out of this, I say!... You wanted Jimmy; there
he is, look!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily, furious, jerked her head toward the passage.</p>
<p>When Lily went home again she did not even think of
what she had just heard. The death of the Paras; the
Graces ... Nunkie, that old rogue!... She
forgot all about it.... She saw only that: the
theater, the aerobike, the theater! Ah! she had it in
her blood, in spite of those ugly stories! Even outside,
when, upon Jimmy&#8217;s advice, she went to take the air in
the parks, under the great blue sky, she regretted the dark
stage, the canvas landscapes of the back-drops; the open-air
scenery appeared paltry to her, beside it. Between
her and nature there was always the aerobike! In a few
days ... was it possible? She clenched her little
hands over an imaginary handle-bar, hardened her pigeon&#8217;s
eggs, made pedaling movements, in spite of herself,
on the floor of the tram-car which she very soon took to
get back to the theater again! It was her life, her joy,
her suffering, her good and evil ... it was her field,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
her very own field, the field which she had sown with
sweat that she might reap fame and glory.</p>
<p>And, when she returned, she reveled in that smell of
hot glue and tar and scent; oh, it was much nicer than
the country! And more interesting, too: all the little
drama that was being enacted among the Graces, for instance;
Nunkie had lost his wonderful reputation, he was
surrounded with less reverence; the story of the confiscated
letters was beginning its round of the world. It
was all very well for him to spoil his dear girls, to double
his attentions, to treble the doses of bromide; there was
no doubt about it, the troupe&#8217;s days were numbered. The
boy-violinist and others were making love to the Three
Graces, fresh troupes were being formed, three more,
any number! And they all talked freely, turned their
backs without hesitation upon Nunkie, who was prowling
round:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;What&#8217;s the mystery?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were discussing marriage, Nunkie,&#8221; the Graces
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, my children,&#8221; he replied, with a sigh.</p>
<p>Lily, in all these plots and counter-plots, knew how to
remain neuter and to be very nice to everybody; she had
been trained from childhood to keep her opinions to herself;
none of her damned business, all that; something
that might have been foreseen and expected ... like
the death of old Martello, which Jimmy told her of....
Yes, the old man had flickered out in his bed just
like that....</p>
<p>But she needed all her composure, indeed, when Jimmy
told her that those dear little Bambinis ... ah, there
was bad news for them, the poor loves!</p>
<p>&#8220;What? What?&#8221; asked Lily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we are going to lose them; they&#8217;ve been claimed
by their brother, it seems.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Lily. &#8220;Their brother? The ...
the Mexican one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;He&#8217;s come back from
South America. He is in Paris now ... somewhere
in a penny show, in the suburbs ... I don&#8217;t know
where ... with a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With a girl!&#8221; thought Lily.</p>
<p>Everything returned to her in a flash! The girl with
the bruised skin ... that boy&#8217;s body all muscle
... Ave Maria! Ave Maria! Not dead! She felt
inclined to run up to Trampy, to fly at his throat, to bellow
in his face that Ave Maria was here, just to see the
effect! But she restrained herself. Suppose it were
not true? Oh, she would soon know! That footy rotter,
if it were true! O God, grant that it might be true!</p>
<p>All this passed through her brain in less than a second.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; said Jimmy, seeing her turn pale. &#8220;Does that
affect you so much ... the loss of your little
friends, the Bambinis? For you&#8217;re going to lose
them....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Jimmy!&#8221; she replied indignantly. &#8220;You shall not
give up the Bambinis to their brother, a cruel, cowardly
brute like that, right at the bottom of the profession. I
know ... I&#8217;ve seen.... You shan&#8217;t do it,
Jimmy, and, look here, I forbid you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Lily, Lily, I&#8217;ll do what I can, to please you, you
know; I&#8217;ll try; I&#8217;ll see the police; you must give your
evidence, if you have anything to say. Do you know,
Lily, you are as good as gold. You&#8217;re a good little Lily:
hard upon herself and kind to others.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he was interrupted ... Jimmy here, Jimmy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
there ... he was wanted ... for the flies, for
the roof.... Jimmy flew to the stage, bothered on
every side, worried by the Astrarium ... and Lily.
Lily! He could not escape her now, do what he might!
He had her in his heart, in his brain, everywhere. She
lived and existed in his breast, shot up there like a flame!
Whatever he had been told about her he no longer knew,
did not want to know. And, besides, even if it had been
true, oh, he would have forgiven everything! He would
have passed over everything! He would have plunged
into the abyss to get Lily out of it, whatever she had
done; yes! In spite of everything! in spite of everybody!
In spite of Trampy, husband or not!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>To-morrow was to be the great day, the opening of the
Astrarium, the first night; and Jimmy, more bustled than
ever, forgot Lily ... almost ... on that evening,
especially, the evening of the dress-rehearsal: not an
ordinary rehearsal, with the band-parts handed to the
conductor across the footlights&mdash;&#8220;A march here, please,
a waltz there. &#8217;K you&#8221;&mdash;no, the whole show, with
orchestra and all complete; the stage flooded with light;
each turn in its own setting: corridor, wood, room,
palace. Jimmy multiplied himself in the final fever.
The theater, arranged according to his ideas, was still encumbered
with ladders and scaffoldings; but gangs of
laborers were hard at work on every side. The obstructions
all disappeared like magic, were juggled away.
Jimmy had made sure that the roof was ready; he had run
from the landing-point, out of sight of the audience,
through the door contrived in the wall of the stage,
crossed the fly-galleries, come down by the pulley-rope;
the whole thing, from roof to stage, had taken him, watch
in hand, thirty seconds. And Lily had done it also. It
formed part of the turn, a sensational addition to the aerobike.
All would be ready, all would go well, provided
that Lily was not nervous that evening ... and to-morrow
especially! Those confounded crazy little girls!
Crazy every one of them: Laurence herself, the bravest of
the lot, had just had an awful fall, at Boston, in her excitement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
at losing her lucky charm. It was the event in
the profession, the accident of the day. Lily might be
frightened by it. Now it was essential that she should
succeed and succeed at the first attempt. His fortune and
hers, his future, the success of the Astrarium depended
on it. And Jimmy, obsessed by his labors, had hardly
time to think of Trampy, in the formidable effort of the
eleventh hour. And yet, sometimes, he felt a pain at his
heart. That adorable Lily! Would he succeed in making
her love him? And now there was that impersonator!
Oh, to work, to work! And he went at it, hammer and
tongs, to make sure of the aerobike&#8217;s success. To make
them talk of him ... to achieve fame ...
which was as sweet as love! And he was wanted from
one end of the theater to the other. Oh, he might well
look upon the Astrarium as his creation! Already, a few
days before, rumors of a strike were current. The managers
were boycotted by the artistes, in England....
Jimmy feared lest the Astrarium should feel the consequences,
under the pressure of the Performers&#8217; Association,
but he had arranged everything, seen each artiste separately,
explained his plans: gala matinées, creation of an
asylum, a home of rest ... a glory to help in such a
task ... who could tell but that they were working for
themselves by adding their stone to the edifice? He
quoted the Para-Paras and their wretched end; old Martello,
dead without leaving a penny; the Bambinis, homeless;
Ave Maria, unprotected. The men listened, with
serious faces. As for the girls, his words came straight
from the heart. Those decent girls, who earned their
living as they knew how and the living of others besides,
they understood him at once; and Lily no longer laughed;
on the contrary:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Me? Whatever you like! For nothing, if you like;
rely on me, Jimmy!&#8221;</p>
<p>And now the hour had come; they were to appear under
the critical eye of Harrasford. The acting-manager
had arrived from England that same day with the stage-manager,
who was &#8220;behind.&#8221; It made a strange impression,
that huge red-and-gold house, glittering with
light and sounding curiously empty to the thunder of
the band. Everybody was at his post: the tall flunkeys
stood motionless at the entrance-doors, in the promenades,
as if the audience had been there, whereas there was
practically nobody except Harrasford and the manager.
And on the stage, which had been cleared of every superfluous
piece of property, splendid order reigned: the
scene-shifters, up above, had their hands on the windlasses;
the two electricians, on their perches, turned the
lime-light where it was to fall; the drops rose and fell
without a hitch; the scenes slipped into their places,
shifted, in the English fashion, by one man. For each
turn on the stage, the next was ready to come on, no
more; all the rest were in the dressing-rooms. But there,
behind the iron curtain, one could picture staircases
crowded with people running up and down, passages
full of light, a flurried ant-hill, and feel that a ring of
bells would be enough to bring tumbling on to the stage
a whole glittering, grotesque or radiant world of people,
from the monkey-faced comedian to Lily, in her pink
tights, an image of Venus. There was electricity in the
air of that empty house, in which all felt the presence
of the powerful master, harder to please than a crowd!
And rays of light ran along the stage, the back-drop
seemed a cloud ready to split in the crash of the thunder,
under the storm of the raging brasses. On the stage,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
the turns defiled in their order, under the shimmering
lights: the Bambinis, brother and sister, supple grace
and strength combined, filled the huge space with the
free play of their rosy bodies and the brightness of their
genuine gaiety. The Three Graces formed the human
cluster, a hanging group of faces, figures, shoulders and
glorious lines. The program poured out laughter, harmony,
beauty, till, against the blue forest, came the scarlet
step-dances of the Roofers. And then silence: the
feature of the evening, the aerobike! There was a moment&#8217;s
anxiety. A net was stretched above the stalls,
from the footlights to the opening in the roof. For the
audience, at any rate, all danger was removed, even in
case of a fall. Then the glass dome above opened, and
the curtain rose on the Elysian glimmer of a scene
studded with stars; and everything was empty, stage and
auditorium. The distance seemed immense: &#8220;miles and
miles!&#8221; The machine was to start out suddenly, rush
through space, disappear up above, like a meteor that
shoots out from infinity and returns to it.</p>
<p>A few seconds passed, during which Jimmy gave Lily
her last instructions:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not afraid, Lily? Would you like me to do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Afraid! She turned her calm face to him. Oh, she
could have accomplished impossible and cruel things,
braved torture, walked on burning coals! She felt herself
made of supple steel, unerring and exact:</p>
<p>&#8220;Up, quick, quick! Ready, Jimmy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then ... GO!&#8221;</p>
<p>The aerobike flashed like an arrow from the bow,
raised itself with a magnificent jerk; the propeller
hummed like a thunder-bolt, the wings rustled in flight,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
pointed toward the opening, went up ... up ...
up ... disappeared in the star-strewn sky....
It was done! The band struck up the triumphal march,
Harrasford, the manager, the few who were present all
burst into cheers; and, suddenly, over the house plunged
in darkness, from the back of the stage, came a burst of
light. Lily, after running over the roof and sliding
down the pulley, was descending against the blue back-drop,
bringing with her the star! First, one saw the
light breaking, then swelling and increasing in brilliancy,
and Lily appeared, a starry Eve, holding, in her upraised
hand, a dazzling luminary, a crystal globe, which an invisible
wire from behind filled with an intensity of light.
And powerful rays shot to every side, end-of-the-world
coruscations, above the crater of the orchestra.</p>
<p>&#8220;Splendid!&#8221; cried Harrasford. &#8220;That dishes the waterspouts
at the Hippodrome, the avalanches, everything!&#8221;
And, as Jimmy came up, &#8220;Good boy, Jimmy!&#8221; he said,
catching him a great smack on the shoulder by way of a
compliment. &#8220;And your girl ... your ...
Maggy ... your ... what&#8217;s her name? Lily
... glorious! Very good indeed! Couldn&#8217;t be better!
Capital idea!&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave a quick glance at his watch, a few words to
Jimmy, to the manager, over his shoulder, on the wing:</p>
<p>&#8220;All the boxes booked three weeks ahead? All the
stalls? That&#8217;s right! Good-by, good luck!&#8221;</p>
<p>Already his broad back was disappearing through the
door; had to catch the midnight train for Cologne; presence
indispensable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telephone to-morrow; let me know how things go.
Ta-ta!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Harrasford was far away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span></p>
<p>And Lily? Lily was in her dressing-room, stupefied
with delight. How soon it was done! How simple it
was! Jimmy, after all, with his scrawls and his scribbles,
with his brain-work: what a discovery he had made!
She would have liked it to last for ever, the flight on the
aerobike; she still seemed to be rushing up to the stars,
to feel the coolness of the night on her face. How funny
it was, going up, up, up and out through that hole. She
was still laughing at it, with little convulsive movements
of the shoulders, and stammering out things.</p>
<p>When she was dressed, she received Jimmy&#8217;s congratulations
and everybody&#8217;s. They gave her a bouquet:</p>
<p>&#8220;To our little favorite!&#8221;</p>
<p>She answered, without knowing what she said; went
home. Everything seemed to be turning round and
round. She ate a few mouthfuls, washed down with a
glass of milk; and then, suddenly, made a rush for Glass-Eye!
A pillow fight followed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, take that! Take that! And that! And that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten minutes of an epic struggle, on the bed thrown
into confusion and disorder, as after a murder; huge
slaps on the firm, rounded forms; virile smackings; and
Glass-Eye, breathlessly, had to own herself beaten, to beg
for mercy.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll teach them!&#8221; cried Lily, falling on the bed,
panting, drunk with joy, drunk with joy! Trampy,
Mexico, Ma&#8217;s insults, the jealousies, the grudges, Daisy,
the fat freaks: pooh, none of that existed for her! Nothing
remained but herself, drunk with an immense joy!
She was almost delirious, in the excess of her great happiness:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll smash up their damned troupes, do you hear,
Glass-Eye? There! Like that!&#8221; And she tried to renew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
the fight, but her strength failed her. &#8220;Dished and
done for, their damned troupes!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she laughed, she burst with laughing, when she
thought of their eighteen feet of stage:</p>
<p>&#8220;Stages as big as my hand, Glass-Eye, is what they&#8217;ve
got to turn in!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereas, she went straight up in the air, up to the
stars, miles high, up above everything! Bang! A smack
for Glass-Eye, who was just taking off her skirt!</p>
<p>&#8220;And I say, Glass-Eye! Ma, who said that I ...
you know what she said! But wait till they see me in my
grand dresses! I&#8217;ll order them to-morrow; and my hats
too. And I&#8217;ll invite Pa and Ma to the hotel! And we&#8217;ll
drink champagne and I&#8217;ll have fifty francs&#8217; worth of
flowers on the table, just to show them! &#8216;Our Lily,&#8217; that&#8217;s
what I&#8217;m going to be, &#8216;our own Lily,&#8217; damn it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily, when she was in bed, turned things over and
over in her brain. Yes, her Pa was quite right. It was
for her good, for her own good! Big salaries, which
would all belong to her! And no more performing-dog
toques, but big hats and feathers and motor-cars
and furs, but no goggles! No, she must find something
that wouldn&#8217;t hide her face, so that people would recognize
her and say:</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Lily!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the road behind her motor would be strewn with
the bodies of pros who had died of jealousy!</p>
<p>And she would consult Pa and Ma on the color of her
liveries, on her crest: a wheel, with wings to it! And
Lily dropped off into a sleep interrupted by awful nightmares,
in which Ma was dead&mdash;poor Ma!&mdash;before witnessing
her triumph&mdash;and in which elephants trumpeted
in her honor and sea-lions applauded her with their finny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
fore-paws, all along a queer sort of Tottenham Court
Road, paved with fat freaks, at the end of which a Horse
Shoe, as big as the Marble Arch, opened out upon the
stars.</p>
<p>Poor Glass-Eye, on her side, had the most outlandish
dreams. Her brain was turned from living in the midst
of all that. She dreamed that she was flying, too; that
she was Lily in her turn; that she was soaring over
Whitechapel; but, from time to time, a nervous kick from
Lily recalled her to the realities of life.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Glass-Eye! There&#8217;s a knock at the door, I think. Or
else I&#8217;m dreaming. What&#8217;s the time? Ten o&#8217;clock. Get
up, Glass-Eye! If it&#8217;s the landlady, tell her I&#8217;ll pay her
next week!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Glass-Eye, who had gone to the door, shut it suddenly
and came back to Lily, looking quite startled:</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Lily, there&#8217;s some one, all in black, on the stairs;
a ghost!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re trying to frighten me,&#8221; cried Lily, jumping
out of bed, &#8220;I&#8217;ll knock your other eye out! Take care!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was choking with excitement. Lily was afraid of
nothing. But those confounded ghosts: poor Ma, perhaps!
And she quickly separated two fingers wide behind
her back, so as to be on the safe side and ward off
ill-luck:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me, Glass-Eye; you go first!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily, in her night-dress, half-opened the door,
looked out.</p>
<p>A thin woman, all in black, stood motionless. It was
not Ma. Lily breathed more freely:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to speak to Miss Lily,&#8221; said the woman in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
black. &#8220;I went to the theater and they gave me your
address. I came.... I suppose you don&#8217;t remember
me, it&#8217;s so long ago. Ave Maria, on the wire in
Mexico?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ave Maria! Come in,&#8221; said Lily.</p>
<p>Ave Maria, whom she had sought for so long. She
would know at last! Oh, if it were true! God grant
that it might be true! Lily, hardly recovered from her
fright, quivered at the thought. And she devoured Ave
Maria with her eyes. She recognized her, now that she
knew: it was she indeed, but grown old before her time,
looking wretched, thin, hollow-eyed, a face all skin and
bone. And the two stood contemplating each other in
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;How pretty you&#8217;ve grown!&#8221; whispered Ave Maria
timidly. &#8220;No one would take you for a professional.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a sudden fit of coughing brought scarlet patches
to her pale cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It catches me here,&#8221; she said, pressing her hand to
her chest. &#8220;It&#8217;s damp, sometimes, in the tent. And then
half-naked on those trestles. The work warms one, it&#8217;s
true. The other night I saw some one who knew you,
a gentleman. I should have liked to ask him more, but
my brother struck him in the face. I got my turn after.
However, I wanted to see you. I went to the Astrarium.
I asked them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Lily, who was burning to know, but did
not want to show it. &#8220;Glass-Eye, give me my dressing-gown.
Go on, please!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I dare,&#8221; said Ave Maria, &#8220;now that
I have seen you. You are so much better-looking than
I am. Are you still living with him?&#8221; she asked, in a
low voice, fixing two fiery eyes on Lily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Lily, &#8220;I am living with nobody!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they told me. I heard at Buenos Ayres ...
the story of the whippings, your running away with
him....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What whippings? And I&#8217;m living with nobody!&#8221; retorted
Lily, very haughtily.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have lived with him ... in Germany
... Trampy, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Lily, &#8220;I was married, wasn&#8217;t I, Glass-Eye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But <i>I&#8217;m</i> married to him!&#8221; Ave Maria broke in, more
aggressively than before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if it were true!&#8221; thought Lily. &#8220;Oh, if it were
true!&#8221;</p>
<p>She dared not believe it, it would have been too beautiful,
beautiful beyond dreams. And, with her nerves
stretching to breaking-point:</p>
<p>&#8220;Prove it!&#8221; she said coldly, to Ave Maria.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have my proofs,&#8221; replied Ave Maria, shaken
with a furious cough. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll show them! Trampy
belongs to me, not to you! He&#8217;s in Paris, they tell
me.... And I mean to have him, do you hear?
I&#8217;ve suffered enough and to spare. I&#8217;ve done everything
since he left me. Look here, at Caracas people
used to offer me twopence to let them black my eye,
sometimes, when my brother was locked up at the police-station.
And there were the one-horse circuses where we
slept in a heap on the straw, in Chili or some such country.
And, sometimes, I lost my balance on the wire, because
of my cough. And my brother: you know him!
And the cattle-men, when they&#8217;re drunk! One of them
stabbed me here, with a knife, there, here, in the breast;
they had to cut it off&mdash;the breast&mdash;later, at Montevideo,
because of the gangrene. Yes, he stabbed me with a knife,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
because I wouldn&#8217;t say, &#8216;I love you,&#8217; to him! Fancy my
saying, &#8216;I love you,&#8217; to any one but Trampy! Never! I
would have let them jump on my chest with their hobnailed
boots first! And, now that Trampy&#8217;s here, I want
him! He belongs to me and I mean to have him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, take him, if he belongs to you!&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t care a hang for your Trampy; I&#8217;ve turned him out
long ago!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So ... it&#8217;s true? If he&#8217;s no longer with you, I
can have him again. I shall have him! I&#8217;ll have my
brother locked up, if necessary, to be free! I have only
to say a word, not because of the story of that nose which
he bit off at Rio: no, the other day, at Vaugirard, he
used the knife. I&#8217;ll tell everything, to have my Trampy
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>And her rough voice became gentle now, in her Anglo-Italian
jargon, with a dash of Spanish in it; everything
became clear, everything yielded before the violence of
that fierce love. Lily was astounded to hear it:</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I call love!&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I had no
idea, my! And all for Trampy! It&#8217;s worse than in the
novels.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she was touched, in spite of herself, and, when
Ave Maria cried, &#8220;Oh, how happy you must be, if he
loves you!&#8221; Lily dared not protest that she didn&#8217;t care
a hang for that soaker, for fear of hurting the poor
martyr. She replied, on the contrary, that Trampy was
very nice, but that he was hers no longer, that he belonged
to Ave Maria, since Ave Maria had the proofs
... <i>if</i> she had the proofs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have them here, Miss Lily, my marriage-lines. I
was able to get them, after he went. I had the certificate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
witnessed. My brother, when he came to fetch me, never
knew about it. I sewed it into the lining of a portmanteau;
no chance of losing it: here it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she produced a yellow document from her bodice
and laid it on the table.</p>
<p>Lily seized upon it ... read it at a glance ... it
was quite regular! Oh, the footy rotter! Two wives!
To say nothing of his thirty-six girls! And what a fine
trick she would play him! At last, she was about to
get rid of her festering sore! She could not breathe for
happiness. And, as Ave Maria was watching her movements,
lest she should keep the paper, Lily handed it back
to her, certain that it was in good hands, that it would not
be lost.</p>
<p>Then and there an idea came to her. Trampy would
be at the theater that afternoon with Tom, who, knowing
little about all these stories, interested only in the condition
of those biceps of his, had taken Trampy as his assistant
and had told Lily so. And Lily had said nothing,
reserving to herself the right to have him turned off the
stage by Jimmy, with a smack in the eye, before everybody:
the footy rotter, coming there to defy her! Well,
there would be no smack in the eye; she would simply
hand him over to Ave Maria, as one flings a lump of
carrion to a tigress!</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a bit, you faithful husband!&#8221; she growled.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll see, presently!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, first of all, when Ave Maria rose to go, Lily forbade
her to do anything of the kind, for fear that the
brother, who must be out looking for her, might drag her
back to the booth at the fair and then take the first train
to some other place, after getting hold of the Bambinis.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
And Lily meant none of all this to take place; she would
rather go to the police and have the brute arrested!</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay here, Ave Maria,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you back
your Trampy this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, if she had been alone, how she would have flown
at Glass-Eye, to work off her superabundant joy! It
would have been a merciless fight, with slaps in the
Mexican style! But a lady receiving her friends must
set a good example. She contented herself with hustling
Glass-Eye by word and gesture:</p>
<p>&#8220;My new dress! My big hat!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ave Maria, quite taken up with the excitement of seeing
Trampy again, of having him back again, left herself
in Lily&#8217;s hands. She felt as if she were looking at
a princess, when Lily made Glass-Eye spin round the
room. She could not even help smiling when she saw
Glass-Eye catch her foot in the dresses spread out on
the floor, so much so that Lily asked her angrily if she
meant to go on hopping about like that for ever, if she
really wanted to have a candle lit in her glass eye to make
her see that bodice, there, right in front of her nose,
damn it! And Glass-Eye&#8217;s fright, when she heard that
... though Glass-Eye was never surprised at anything
that Lily said or did!</p>
<p>Going to the Astrarium, Lily, followed by Glass-Eye,
walked along the street with her cheeky feather waving
like a flag in battle. Ave Maria, by her side, kept close
to the wall, with frightened glances to right and left; Lily
did not call her attention to the Astrarium posters for fear
of humiliating her: she would have had to explain that
she was topping the bill and poor Ave Maria, who
was starring at the fair, would never have understood.
A professional abyss separated the two of them. Lily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
saw this and had too kind a heart to let the other feel it.
What a difference between them! Merely in the way in
which Lily entered the theater and smiled to the stage-doorkeeper!
Ave Maria followed very timidly, like a
beggar-woman stealing into a palace. She felt out of her
element in those big theaters, where she had not appeared
for ever so long, having come down to the level of one-horse
circuses, patched canvas tents, acrobatic performances
in the open air, on the slack-wire stretched from
tree to tree. Lily looked a princess beside her, really. Ave
Maria was even surprised to see her address a gentleman
who was there: it was the architect, with a bandage
over his eye. Ave Maria recognized him; and he, rendered
prudent by the blow which he had received from
&#8220;her man,&#8221; stepped back instinctively at the sight of her.
But Lily caught him by the lapel of his coat:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been fooling me ... with your measurements,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and there are certain things that jossers
oughtn&#8217;t to meddle with; and it serves you right, that
black eye of yours; but I forgive you, because of the immense
service you&#8217;re doing me ... without knowing
it ... you lover of second-rate goods!&#8221; she
muttered, as she watched him slink off, taking her forgiveness
with him.</p>
<p>The stage was almost empty. Tom had come, not
Trampy; so much the better, there would be all the more
there presently, for the great scene!</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait for me a minute,&#8221; she said to Ave Maria. &#8220;Sit
down over there, in the corner.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lily went up to her dressing-room; she wanted
to look her best, to bedizen herself ... a little red
on her lips, a little blue on her eyelids ... to make
Trampy regret the more what he was going to lose. And,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
when she was ready, Jimmy passed and, icicle though he
was, could not help paying her a compliment on her good
looks. He appeared quite disconcerted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Just imagine, Lily. What do you think happened to
me, in the impersonator&#8217;s dressing-room? I had something
to say to him ... I walk in ... see the
impersonator half undressed ... and it&#8217;s a woman,
Lily, a magnificent woman! You never told me, you
kiddie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;Don&#8217;t give her away; it&#8217;s a secret,
it&#8217;s her living, Jimmy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, Lily, I won&#8217;t prevent any one from
earning her living, as long as she does all right on the
stage. But I don&#8217;t know where I am now. That woman
who came in with you, for instance,&#8221; continued Jimmy
jestingly, &#8220;she looks just like a man; there&#8217;s no knowing;
nothing would surprise me after that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a woman, Jimmy, a married woman! You&#8217;ll
see presently. We&#8217;ll have a good laugh; mind you&#8217;re
there! I want everybody to be there! It&#8217;s a surprise,
Jimmy!&#8221;</p>
<p>What a kiddie she was, thought Jimmy, as he went
down the stairs. The architect, the impersonator: the
two scandals of her life. That impersonator whom she
kissed in front of him, a story that had gone round the
world, Lily&#8217;s love affairs, one more ready to leave wife
and children for her sake: the exaggeration of the stage,
always; professional boasting. Like the story of the
whippings, like those girls whom she had described to
him, and herself, with all over her skin&mdash;&#8220;Here, here,
damn it!&#8221;&mdash;wounds that you could put your finger into.
Or like those who were said to be done for, or burned
alive, or drowned in shipwrecks, with waves miles high,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
all for the honor of the profession; when, perhaps, it
was simply as good a way as another of retiring from
the stage, to get married, with a flourish of trumpets!
It wasn&#8217;t true, all that, or their parade of vice either, all
humbug, from end to end, their amorous conquests, their
orgies, their escapades, like their ostrich-feathers, that
long, or their sham diamonds, that big, and bouquets
large enough to fill a cab. But they were decent-hearted
girls, all the same: that Lily, what a kiddie, thought
Jimmy, feeling quite comforted, quite glad on her account.</p>
<p>And just then, as luck would have it, he met Tom, to
whom Glass-Eye had brought Miss Lily&#8217;s album, with a
request for his autograph. Tom, whose formidable
muscles were hardly capable of wielding a pen, especially
to write &#8220;thoughts,&#8221; was holding the album with a sheepish
look, turning it round and round:</p>
<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; he said, as Jimmy passed, &#8220;write something;
for me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; said Jimmy.</p>
<p>And he lightly turned the pages of the album, the famous
album, said to be crammed with passionate declarations.
Not a bit of it! Nothing but foolery and childish
nonsense:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Puedo decir que nunca he visto yoo ... tan cuida y

<p>There was page upon page, in this style, with, here and
there, a rough sketch: a heart pierced by an arrow, signed,
&#8220;Castaigne;&#8221; a dried shamrock: &#8220;Blarney Castle;&#8221; a bit
of seaweed: &#8220;Dundee.&#8221; Jimmy smiled to himself and
especially at what he heard beside him, where Glass-Eye,
while gazing wide-eyed at Tom&#8217;s immense arms, was telling
him all her troubles: quite mad, Miss Lily, ought to
be locked up! And <i>she</i> ought to know: never left her
side since she began traveling by herself, day or night.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a lucky one, you are!&#8221; Tom broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to see you try it, just!&#8221; Glass-Eye retorted.
&#8220;And meantime I get more smacks than halfpence.
Oh, I know she&#8217;ll pay me all in a lump, when she gets it!
She&#8217;s very generous, really. And her Pa and Ma ...
yes ... do you know what she means to do? She&#8217;s
not angry with them any longer. She&#8217;s going to stuff
them with turkey and pudding at the hotel and stand
them fifty francs&#8217; worth of flowers. She&#8217;s forgiven
them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more than I have!&#8221; replied Tom. &#8220;Her Pa
will know what I am made of to-morrow, the brute!
He&#8217;ll have one on the mug, for boxing my ears and kicking
me out ... you know ... because of the
letters from Trampy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do that, Tom, you&#8217;ll have Miss Lily to reckon
with! What! You&#8217;re laughing!&#8221; cried Glass-Eye angrily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
&#8220;You don&#8217;t know how it hurts ... on one&#8217;s
bones! And those pillow-fights: I&#8217;ve had my nose
smashed in one of them before now! Nothing surprises
me that Miss Lily says or does. Why, this very morning,
she wanted to put a lighted candle in my glass eye!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, what? A light in your eye?&#8221; exclaimed Tom
suddenly. &#8220;I wonder if one really could ... I say,
Jimmy, could one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jimmy, greatly amused, &#8220;with an invisible
wire under the dress....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Tom. &#8220;Would you like two shillings
a day, Glass-Eye? And your food and clothes? You
shall travel with me; you shall appear on the stage. Come
along to the café, we&#8217;ll sign the engagement!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what will Miss Lily say?&#8221; objected Glass-Eye,
trembling at the idea of announcing her departure to her
terrible mistress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be nice to her Pa, if she&#8217;s nice
to you. Come along!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know how to sign my name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can make your mark, before two witnesses.
Come along!&#8221;</p>
<p>Glass-Eye, dazzled and beglamored, followed Tom.
She, an artiste! On the stage! At last! Going round
the world with Tom ... living with him ...
married ... almost!</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s come in the nick of time!&#8221; said Jimmy, as he
watched her go off the stage. &#8220;Lily, perhaps ... in
her new position ... will want a real maid, not a
Glass-Eye! Lily ... why, she&#8217;s perfection! To
think of the abysses she has walked along without falling!
There&#8217;s more merit than one thinks in that kind of life.
And how I should like to get hold of the people who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
talk ill of her. And that ... that ... oh,
that one!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Jimmy clenched his fists, at the thought of
Trampy, and his heart burst forth: all his patient, brave,
manly heart, now well nigh exhausted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>Poor Ave Maria, indifferent to what was going on before
her, was still waiting on the stage. For that matter,
it was but a few minutes since Lily brought her there.
Ave Maria felt inclined to go
and meet Trampy on the
pavement, to throw her arms
round his neck as soon as he
appeared. But Lily had earnestly
recommended her not
to move, whatever happened.
So she remained in her corner
and, under the pale light,
with her back to the forest
scene, in the shadow, Ave
Maria looked like a lurking
she-wolf, ready to leap out at
any moment.</p>
<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/illus-pg371.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 195px; height: 279px;' /><br />
<p class='captionc' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 195px;'>
AVE MARIA<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>As for Lily, she tripped
down the stairs to the stage,
for a few seconds contemplated
all those bill-toppers at
her feet, so to speak; but she took the last stairs at a
bound: Trampy had just entered! Ave Maria, in her corner,
behind the pillars and the confused heap of scenery,
could not see him. Lily preferred that. She would
manage everything her own way and get rid of him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
once and for all ... get rid of that footy rotter
who had come there to jeer at her. He stepped along,
with his hat on one side and a dead cigar between his
teeth. Trampy, broken, diseased, done for, was jubilant
for all that; turned his broad smile from girl to girl,
winked his eye gaily at the Roofers, who drew back in
disgust, and, with outstretched hand:</p>
<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;you do, Lily? How&#8217;s my dear little wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>He enjoyed the humiliation which he was inflicting
upon her, would have liked his clothes to be still shabbier,
his shoes more down at heel, so that he might thoroughly
disgrace his dear little wife&mdash;that great bill-topper,
who was leaving the pink of husbands in such a state
of destitution. And he threw out his chest, increased his
familiarities, and even pretended to kiss her, pushed his
blotched and pimpled mug close to that charming face.
Jimmy gave a bound: Trampy! On the stage! Lily&#8217;s
tormentor! Jimmy, pale with fury, walked up to him,
stiff-armed, ready to break the jaw of that thief in the
night and chuck him into the street, without more words!
But Lily stopped him with a quick gesture:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Jimmy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;would you keep a man from
earning his living? Do you find fault with a husband
for loving his little wife? I am your little wife, am I
not?&#8221; she continued, tantalizing Trampy with her peach-like
cheek, tickling his nose with her fair curls. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you deserve a dear little wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course I do!&#8221; Trampy agreed, surprised,
all the same, at this loving reception from his dear little
wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; cried Lily, unable to restrain herself any
longer and giving him a box on the ears. &#8220;That&#8217;ll teach
you to call me your little wife, you damned tramp cyclist!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
I&#8217;ve never been your little wife. I&#8217;ll show you your little
wife, the real one. Come along, Ave Maria! Here&#8217;s
Trampy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, what?&#8221; said Trampy, turning color. &#8220;Ave Maria?
I don&#8217;t know any Ave Maria.&#8221;</p>
<p>But already Ave Maria was upon him, pressing him in
her arms: her Trampy! And her cough brought pink-red
patches to her hectic cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this mean? I don&#8217;t know you,&#8221; he stammered,
gazing horror-stricken at this old, lean woman,
who was taking possession of him before everybody, taking
possession of him who cared only for plump little
things, sultan that he was. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know her, I don&#8217;t
know her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; cried Lily, snatching the paper from Ave
Maria&#8217;s bodice. &#8220;Do you know that? Can you read?
Now will you deny that she&#8217;s your wife ... your
wife ... your wife?&#8221; she repeated, rejoicing in being
able to hurl the word to Trampy, who turned pale
with fright.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try and arrange it,&#8221; whispered Jimmy, still
hardly recovered from his surprise. &#8220;A divorce in Lily&#8217;s
favor first! She&#8217;ll dictate your answer for you; you&#8217;ve
only got to say yes to everything. And then you can be
off somewhere; to West Australia. I&#8217;ll pay your expenses.
And don&#8217;t you ever dare to show your face
again! Never! Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;ll teach you to make little of people!&#8221; cried
Lily. &#8220;Let&#8217;s drink to the health of Trampy, the faithful
husband! I&#8217;ll stand champagne all round to the health
of good old Trampy and his dear little wife!&#8221;</p>
<p>But, without waiting for the champagne, already Ave
Maria was dragging Trampy to the door and the Roofer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
girls gave him a triumphal exit. They sent him to Halifax,
they sent him to Coventry. They flourished things at
his head, amid an uproar of jolly hootings, and took aim
at him&mdash;&#8220;Ping! Ping!&#8221;&mdash;and pinched him, as the Merry
Wives did Falstaff in Windsor Forest. And they slipped
off their shoes in honor of his wedding, by Jove! And
Trampy fled under a shower of boots and slippers, fled
like mad, as though the devil were after him.</p>
<p>Jimmy did not know if he was on his head or his heels
for joy:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stand the champagne!&#8221; he said. &#8220;To Miss Lily&#8217;s
health!&#8221;</p>
<p>So much had happened in those few minutes: Lily
free again ... and no scandal ... the divorce
assured ... Trampy admitting his misdeeds, inventing
them, if necessary, confessing anything they
asked him to, as long as they did not mention bigamy....
Jimmy, had it been possible, would have offered
a general picnic to the whole company. He, usually so
calm, felt inclined to sing, to laugh. Never would he
have dared to hope.... And it had all come so
simply, like the things that are bound to happen. Lily
was free!</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring the bottles up here,&#8221; he said to the call-boy,
&#8220;and biscuits and cakes. We&#8217;ll drink it here! We&#8217;ll
christen the stage, as if we were launching a ship ...
in champagne, here, by ourselves! among ourselves!
Here&#8217;s to the stage-manager! Here&#8217;s to all of us!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily, happy as happy could be, shook everybody by
the hand, distributed a &#8220;&#8217;K you&#8221; here and a &#8220;&#8217;K you&#8221;
there. She would have liked to have Glass-Eye by her
side, to keep her in countenance, open her bag, give her
her handkerchief ... liked to be a little lady who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
can&#8217;t do without her maid ... but, damn it, where
was Glass-Eye? And Lily clenched her fist when she saw
her return with cakes in her hands, escorted by Tom, who
helped to carry the champagne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been, Glass-Eye?&#8221; asked Lily severely.
&#8220;What have you been doing with Tom? Give
me my handkerchief, Glass-Eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your bag, Miss Lily,&#8221; said Glass-Eye excitedly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave you, Miss Lily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; said Lily, feeling vexed. &#8220;Because I
owe you a few little things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, not that! I&#8217;m going to be a star, too; on my
hands: Demon Maud, the lady with the flaming eye; a
candle in my glass eye ... before two witnesses
... I made my mark at the bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s drunk!&#8221; cried Lily, utterly dumfounded. &#8220;Or
else she&#8217;s going mad. Jimmy! Tom! Glass-Eye&#8217;s going
mad!&#8221;</p>
<p>But, when Tom had explained, Lily approved. Glass-Eye
wasn&#8217;t stupid, really; very intelligent, though you&#8217;d
never think it. Glad to see her engaged.... And
she shook her by the hand, like an old friend and comrade,
glad to hear of the success of others ... among artistes....</p>
<p>And, suddenly, with head thrown back, full-throated,
her feather nodding hysterically on her head, Lily
laughed ... laughed ... laughed!</p>
<p>Maud an artiste! On her hands! A candle in her
eye! One fat freak the more on the stage! Gee, they
must drink to Glass-Eye&#8217;s health: Glass-Eye, the bill-topper!</p>
<p>They were all laughing now, filling their glasses at a
table in the middle of the stage, eating cakes, amusing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
themselves with the corks, which went pop, like toy
guns, and applauding with their thumb-nails. To the
Astrarium! And long live jollity! That night, they
would one and all risk their skins. They were like soldiers
drinking to their sweethearts, in the trenches, before
the battle. And everything promised well; already
a legend was forming among the painted faces: the booking
office besieged; ladies and gentlemen in motors;
motors in a row, miles and miles of motors; the street
bursting with people who had come to book seats! And
champagne on the stage, cakes, my, for the asking! An
orgy which would start its trip around the world to-morrow,
with those few bottles transformed into a Niagara of
champagne, enough to flood every greenroom from the
Klondike to Calcutta!</p>
<p>They all enjoyed themselves and let themselves go.
And the Roofers, who worshiped Lily, in spite of
her abominable tricks, raised their glasses to her
health, crowded round her, smiled merrily at her with
their white teeth, congratulated her for sending that footy
rotter packing:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s to Miss Lily! And a round on the thumbnail
in honor of Miss Lily!&#8221;</p>
<p>This christening of the Astrarium was turning into a
triumph for her; and there was the evening to come
... the evening! It made her forget Trampy,
Jimmy, Glass-Eye, everybody. And ... the next
day ... her Pa, her Ma, the New Trickers would
be at her feet! Oh, she would give ten years of her life
if to-morrow could be there now!</p>
<p>And the evening came. Lily did not leave the theater.
She walked nervously from her dressing-room to the
stage, inspected the final operations, interested herself in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
everything, stopped the boy-violinist, who was crossing
the stage with the other members of the band, congratulated
him on his approaching marriage with one of the
Graces. She talked to the artistes going up to their
dressing-rooms, bestowed a smile upon Jimmy, another
on the stage-manager, joked with the limelight-men
working their apparatus on either side of the stage. The
footlights lit up with a row of flames, the storm approached.
There was a ringing of electric bells&mdash;&#8220;Ting!
Ting! Ting!&#8221;&mdash;as in the machine-room of a ship before
the tempest; the orchestra roared; and, as though at a
thunder-clap, the velvet curtain split asunder: Patti-Patty
was revealed on the stage, while the band played
as if possessed. Lily, in the shadow of the wings, put
her hand to her heart; her veins were ablaze. And that
audience, at which she peeped through a crack in the
scenery; that audience was hers, with its rustling silks,
its bare shoulders, its diamonds, its flowers! She would
have liked to step forward, to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I am!&#8221;</p>
<p>She felt herself excited by a curious feeling; an aggressive
mood, which, no doubt, came from all the healths
she had drunk: to the Astrarium, to this one, to that one,
to all of us! Gee, what fun it had been: champagne, cakes,
my, tons of cakes! And Lily, who had long been unused
to any such excess, felt her head splitting. A fever
seemed also to reign all over the dressing-rooms and
passages. They talked of front boxes reserved at a thousand
francs by the Aero Club; stalls at fifty francs; every
seat in the house filled; and the best people, nothing but
the best! Lily, in her exalted condition, took it that they
had all come for her; and she had to dazzle them all!
And soar above them all! To a hurricane of applause
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
from &#8220;her favorite audience,&#8221; the Astrarium audience,
on a first night!</p>
<p>And she felt so gay that she was not angry when Glass-Eye
asked her, now that <i>she</i> was an artiste, too, to teach
her her stage-smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course, Glass-Eye! I owe you that, to say
nothing of the rest! But you won&#8217;t lose by waiting!
Take my word for it: among friends, you know!...&#8221;</p>
<p>And she kissed her maid, felt inclined to cry, became
quite sentimental at her going....</p>
<p>She was less amiable to Nunkie, who was prowling
around near her. Oh, how angry she felt with that old
rogue! Because of Thea, first of all; and then it was he
who gave her away, not Jimmy! Tom had told her.
Nunkie mumbled something to her: his dear girls; ungrateful
creatures who were leaving him! His poor
life shattered! His pigeons, he had his pigeons left; yes,
and his home; but what was that compared with loving
hearts? And, as she was on such good terms with Jimmy
and everybody, couldn&#8217;t she use her influence? Oh, if he
could have the Bambinis, be appointed their guardian!
&#8220;He would bring together such a nice little family troupe:
all the joys of home!</p>
<p>&#8220;You old wretch!&#8221; cried Lily, in a threatening voice.
&#8220;Just go and look, at the corner of Oxford Street and
Newman Street, if you can see me! You old snaky!
You old bromide merchant! Hiding letters, too, you
nigger-driving humbug! Oh, you&#8217;re sure to get the Bambinis,
I <i>don&#8217;t</i> think!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ver-r-rdammt</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nunkie turned on his heel, shaking the passage with
tremendous oaths.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; Lily shot at him from behind sarcastically,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
&#8220;I thought one ought never to swear! It&#8217;s wicked
to swear, Mr. Fuchs!&#8221;</p>
<p>In her dressing-room, she went on laughing at Nunkie
and his &#8220;<i>Donner-r-r-wetter-r-r</i>!&#8221; and his &#8220;<i>S-s-satan</i>!
<i>S-s-satan</i>!&#8221; It made her comb her hair all awry and
apply the grease-paint to her cheeks with a trembling
hand. She felt a buzzing in her head: that confounded
music which seemed to come from everywhere and hissed
in her ears! But, when her turn came, she&#8217;d show them!
Never had she felt so light. She was sure of herself,
strangely sure. It seemed to her that, if need be, she&#8217;d
have shot up to the stars, damn it!</p>
<p>As soon as she was ready, she went down to the stage.
She didn&#8217;t know why. It was her wish to be everywhere,
her craving for movement. The aerobike had been taken
from its cage, behind the back-drop; the stage-manager,
Jimmy and Jimmy&#8217;s assistants were standing round it.
Jimmy was testing everything, for the last time, making
sure that there would be no hitch:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Lily!&#8221; he said, when he saw her. &#8220;Are you
ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready?&#8221; said Lily. &#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she flung back her wrap with her two bare arms
and stood, a figure all charm and grace, with youth, joy
and courage sparkling in her eyes. In the mysterious
half-light, amid the endless sounds from the band, Lily
seemed to shed rays. Jimmy, dazzled, looked at that
dainty form, that delicate breast, those rounded shoulders,
that splendid body fashioned by years of Spartan life,
each muscle of which was quivering with enthusiasm.
And she laughed ... laughed ... head thrown
back, full-throated; told the story of Nunkie, with furious
gestures, as though she were strangling the old beast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
And then came sudden displays of feeling, for the Three
Graces and the Bambinis.</p>
<p>Jimmy had never seen her like that. The stage-manager
also thought her queer, for he looked at Jimmy as
though to ask what on earth was the matter with her.
And, going up to him, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look how she&#8217;s trembling! One would think she had
a fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite true,&#8221; said Jimmy.</p>
<p>And the two stared at each other in consternation
when Lily, stooping to pick up her cloak, was nearly
losing her balance and coming to the ground. They exchanged
a few words in a whisper. Then the stage-manager
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Go up to your dressing-room, Miss Lily. You mustn&#8217;t
stay here, you know. We&#8217;ll send for you when the time
comes. Go and put your hair straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was only a pretext; but the same thought had passed
through both their minds: it was the champagne! Lily,
who was accustomed to drink nothing but water, was
... if not exactly drunk ... well ...</p>
<p>Thereupon, in an instant, Jimmy made up his mind: it
was finished and settled, irrevocably, as though he had
spent hours in reflecting. The newspapers had expressed
doubts; there had been suggestions of trickery.
An immediate, brilliant success was essential, to carry the
thing off: a hitch and all was lost and the luck of the
Astrarium and his own fame vanished in smoke! Lily
was out of the question that night: she was bubbling
over at every pore with unnatural excitement ...
she was not Lily,&mdash;was not herself ... it meant
certain death to her, the aerobike smashed to pieces, the
end of all things! Lily would do it to-morrow, the next
night; but not to-night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span></p>
<p>He had just time to go to his dressing-room and put
on his white sweater, black breeches, black stockings:
an athletic costume which he always kept at the theater
in case of need. And quick, in the saddle: the moment
had come! He must succeed, now or never! And
Jimmy, calm and sure of himself, took his seat on the
aerobike. A great silence followed....</p>
<p>Lily, at that very minute, anxious at not being sent for
in her dressing-room, was going back to the stage, but
she was stopped at the top of the stairs by the stage-manager,
who said that he had received an order by telephone
from Cologne, from Harrasford: Lily not to perform
that night....</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me pass,&#8221; cried Lily, laughing in spite of everything.
&#8220;That&#8217;s enough of a joke. It&#8217;s time for me to go
on, I say! Are you mad? I tell you, it&#8217;s my turn!&#8221;</p>
<p>But she ceased, as though struck by thunder. The
aerobike, with wings wide open, was taking flight toward
the stars, in a tempestuous wind.</p>
<p>It was done! The thing had shot past her very nose!
She thought that she would fall, so great was the pain at
her heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; she gasped, with dilated eyes.</p>
<p>And, suddenly, she understood and uttered a cry of
rage!</p>
<p>But she could have shouted, &#8220;Murder!&#8221; and it would
have sounded as the buzzing of a bee amid that explosion
of cheers. And the orchestra grew like a flame and the
light appeared, increased and shone all over the house.</p>
<p>Lily flung herself back, closed her eyes so as not to
see, fled to her dressing-room with a shriek like a
wounded beast&#8217;s....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3></h3>
</div>

<p>She dropped into her chair, stopped up her ears; but
the cheers never ceased, kept on increasing, filled the
theater with a roar as of thunder! Oh, it seemed to
her that her chest was on fire, that they were pounding
her heart; that some one was taking her by the hair and
banging her head against the walls! And that storm of
applause kept on and kept on ... but it wasn&#8217;t
for her! It was for Jimmy all the time: they had tried
it with her, that was all! To see if it worked! And she,
she, she who, only just now, was giving herself airs with
the others: a poor rag, yes, that was all she was, less than
anybody; less than Tom, her old servant, less than Glass-Eye,
that idiot, less than Ave Maria, less than a performing
dog, less than anything, worse than anything, perhaps!
Mad with rage she jumped at her gollywog,
pulled down the white-eyed idol&mdash;the traitor!&mdash;spat on
it, crushed it on the floor with her heel, furious, beside
herself; and then dropped into her chair again, with her
two arms flat on the table, her head between her arms,
among the grease-paints, the powder, the overturned box
of spangles, which rolled about everywhere and strewed
the floor. She felt inclined to bite into her flesh to relieve
herself, she clenched her fists and dug her nails into her
skin. Oh, she would have liked to die, to die! It was so
fierce a longing, so desperate a cry that the force of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
prayer ought to have struck her dead where she sat. And
suddenly the tears began to flow and she cried and cried,
all convulsed with sobs, floored, shipwrecked, done for.
She cried and cried, as though stupefied, saw nothing save
through a thick veil of water, like a person drowning,
sinking. It seemed to her as if the tears would groove
her face, for always. Oh, what would she give to be at
home, in bed! Never, never again would she have the
strength to do a thing. She was done for, buried alive.
And that coward of a Jimmy, to obey Harrasford&#8217;s order!
Oh, the harm he had done her! She would rather have
died smashed to a jelly on the stage: she would have
suffered less! Oh, to behave like that: to flash so much
before her eyes; and then to fling her to the ground! Oh,
when she had thought that he loved her and that she loved
him also, perhaps! And Lily cried and cried....</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Meanwhile, in front, the aerobike was receiving endless
applause. The disappearance through the opening, the
plunge into space, the star snatched from up above, that
piece of theatrical symbolism filled the audience with enthusiasm.
The aerobike brought down the house, its success
surpassed all expectation, and the Astrarium was
opening with a victorious clamor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but at what a cost!&#8221; said Jimmy to himself, in
spite of the cheers.</p>
<p>And, as soon as he was able to escape, putting off for
a few minutes his replies to the cards that poured in&mdash;the
chairman of the Aero Club, journalists begging for interviews&mdash;Jimmy
had but one idea, to console Lily for her
disappointment of that evening: poor Lily!</p>
<p>His heart was beating very loudly as he went to her
dressing-room. Jimmy was no longer the fellow who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
knew no fear. To fly away on the aerobike, to risk his
skin was easy, for him at least; but to face Lily ...
to explain to her ... with all those things seething
within him ... and, oh, the pain he was causing
her! How could he approach her after that? And could
he ever get her to love him? Ah, perhaps it would have
been better if he had gone and broken his neck in the
street, on the pavement! Jimmy was trembling like a
child; in his perturbation, he even forgot to knock at the
door ... turned the knob ... entered....</p>
<p>Lily heard nothing, seemed crushed into her chair,
with her face buried in her right arm folded on the table,
while the left hung lifeless by her side. Her whole attitude
expressed abject misery, profound despair; she
seemed extinguished in a terrifying calmness.</p>
<p>Jimmy, to attract her attention, closed the door noisily.
Lily stirred no more than a wax figure: one might have
thought her dead.</p>
<p>He shivered; and, stepping forward, leaning over to
her, anxiously, he placed his hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>It was like a spring that is suddenly released! Lily
threw up her sorrow-stricken face, down which the tears,
mingling with the red paint, flowed like blood, looked at
him for a few seconds with a wandering air and then
leaped at him, as though she meant to bite him in the face;
but her lips shriveled up in silence, nothing came from
them; and she crushed Jimmy with an unspeakable look
of terror and contempt.</p>
<p>Jimmy did not flinch:</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not be angry with me,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;I
was bound to do it, Lily; I had to save the theater.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And get rid of me!&#8221; cried Lily, wild-haired, hard-eyed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span>
hoarse-throated, with the tears drying on her red-hot
cheeks.</p>
<p>Jimmy was pale as death. Ah, all his dreams, too,
were fading away!</p>
<p>&#8220;Lily,&#8221; he said, in a voice which he strove to make firm,
but which trembled with emotion. &#8220;I have done my duty
to everybody, yourself included! But for me, you would
be lying dead at this minute and the Astrarium would be
ruined. You were not in a state to appear in public
... this evening ... believe me, Lily. The
stage-manager himself....&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily lowered her head under his calm gaze....</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll do it to-morrow,&#8221; continued Jimmy, very
quickly, &#8220;before Pa and Ma! To-morrow and the following
days ... and always! Your name will be right
at the top of the bill! Do you hear? To-morrow ...
and always!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what...? Why...?&#8221; asked Lily, as
though stupefied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Lily,&#8221; he replied, gently raising that face all
distorted with grief. &#8220;Poor little Lily! I have caused
you a heap of pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily, for her sole answer, gave a convulsive sob; a tear
leaped to her eyelids.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; whispered Jimmy, &#8220;don&#8217;t cry any more.
It will be your turn to-morrow, before the New Trickers.
To-morrow! Every night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every night?&#8221; asked Lily, still incredulous and yet
transfigured with hope. &#8220;You&#8217;re saying that, Jimmy;
but....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you doubt my word, Lily?&#8221; he replied, pressing
her gently to him. &#8220;What, I, your best friend, your only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
friend ... I who ... haven&#8217;t I always loved
you, Lily? Do you think I&#8217;ve changed?... I love
you more than ever I did! I will explain everything later.
And you doubt me ... who would give my life
for you; yes, life without you means nothing to me,&#8221;
continued Jimmy, in a stifled voice and clasping Lily in
his arms.</p>
<p>Lily quivered in his embrace, hid her blushing features
on his breast, where she heard great dull throbs. She
trembled from head to foot. Her quickened senses
seemed to perceive everything now; the passing indisposition
from which she had suffered, without knowing it,
the light fumes of the champagne: all that had suddenly
gone, was far away; she had never felt more lucid; she
saw, she understood and was overcome with delight,
overcome with a delight beside which her enthusiasm of
the previous day seemed dark and dreary. The ardor of
her eighteen years swelled her breast. Success, in any
case! To-morrow! And that man was hers, that heart
was hers! It was a dream, an enchantment! Her head
rolled back, a smile drew up her lips, her eyes, through
her tangled curls, seemed all ablaze. Jimmy bent his
glowing face over her. Lily, on the point of swooning,
raised her lips to his.</p>
<p>Vanished around them the low ceiling, the scratched
walls, the shabby rags. Standing on the wretched spangles
that strewed the dusty floor, Lily, drunk with joy
... Jimmy, distraught with pride ... seemed
like youth and love, in mid-sky, among the stars!</p>
